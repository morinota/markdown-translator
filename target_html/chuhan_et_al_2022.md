## 1. Introduction

In the era of the Internet, online news distributing platforms such as Microsoft News1have attracted hundredsof millions of users [223]. Due to the convenience and timeliness of online news services, many users haveshifted their news reading habits from conventional newspapers to digital news content [144]. However, a largenumber of news articles are created and published every day, and it is impossible for users to browse throughall available news to seek their interested news information [204]. Thus, personalized news recommendationtechniques, which aim to select news according to users’ personal interest, are critical for news platforms to helpusers alleviate their information overload of users and improve news reading experience [113]. Researches onpersonalized news recommendation have also attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry inrecent years [144, 203].

Fig. 1. An example workflow of personalized news recommender systems.

An example worklow of personalized news recommender system is shown in Fig. 1. When a user visits thenews platform, the news platform will recall a small set of candidate news from a large-scale news pool, andthe personalized news recommender will rank these candidate news articles according to the user interestsinferred from user proiles. Then, the top K ranked news will be displayed to the user, and the user behaviorson these news will be recorded by the platform to update the maintained user proile for providing futureservices. Although many prior works have extensively studied these problems in diferent aspects, personalizednews recommendation remains challenging. For example, news articles on news websites usually have shortlife cycles. Many new articles emerge every day, and old ones will expire after a short period of time. Thus,news recommendation faces a severe cold-start problem. In addition, news articles usually contain rich textualinformation such as title and body. Thus, it is very important to understand news content from their texts withadvanced natural language processing techniques. Moreover, there is usually no explicit user feedback such asreviews and ratings on news platforms. Thus, we need to infer the personal interests of users from their implicitfeedback like clicks. However, user interests are usually diverse and dynamic, which poses great challenges touser modeling algorithms. The complexity of personalized news recommendation makes it a fascinating researchtopic with various challenges to be tackled [42].

A comprehensive overview of existing personalized news recommendation approaches can provide usefulguidance for future research in this ield. Over the past years, there are many survey papers that review thetechniques of news recommendation [8,10,38ś40,42,64,87,110,113,146,162,181]. For example, Li et al. [113]reviewed the personalized news recommendation methods based on handcrafted features to build news and userrepresentations. They covered many traditional feature-based methods, including collaborative iltering (CF)based ones that use the IDs of users and news, content-based ones that use features extracted from the content ofnews and the user behaviors on news, and hybrid ones that rely on content-based collaborative iltering. They alsostudied the datasets used by these methods and their techniques for user and news representation construction, data processing and user privacy protection. Feng et al. [42] reviewed news recommendation approaches in manydiferent scenarios including personalized and non-personalized ones. For personalized news recommendationmethods, they also classify them into three categories, i.e., CF-based, content-based, and hybrid. They mainlystudied the techniques adopted by diferent methods, the challenges they tackled, and the datasets and metricsfor evaluation. We summarize the taxonomy of news recommendation methods and the literature coverage ofseveral recent survey articles in Table 1. We ind that most surveys mainly focus on traditional feature-basedmethods and only a small part of deep learning-based methods are covered by a few recent surveys, whichis not beneicial for researchers to track recent advances in the personalized news recommendation ield. Inaddition, most surveys follow the canonical taxonomy that categorizes news recommendation methods basedon whether they rely on collaborative or content-based iltering techniques. However, it is diicult for thistaxonomy to distinguish between traditional methods and recent deep learning-based approaches. In addition,the hybrid category contains methods based on quite diverse techniques, e.g., traditional CF-enhanced contentmatching and graph neural network, which is not beneicial for researchers to be aware of the evolution of newsrecommendation technologies. Moreover, several key techniques in news recommender system design, such asranking and model training, are rarely discussed in this paradigm. Thus, the conventional taxonomy used bymost existing surveys cannot meet the development of this ield, and a more systematic taxonomy of existingnews recommendation methods is needed to help understand their characteristics and inspire further research.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the personalized news recommendation ield. Instead of reviewing existing personalized news recommendation methods based on the conventional taxonomy, in this survey we propose a novel perspective to review them based on the core problems involved in personalized news recommendation and the associated techniques and challenges. We irst introduce the framework of developing a personalized news recommender system in Section 2. Next, we systematically review the core problems, techniques and challenges in personalized news recommendation, including: news modeling, user modeling, personalized ranking, model training, datasets, benchmarks and evaluation, which are introduced in Sections 3-7, respectively. Through our proposed framework, the characteristics of existing approaches can be more accurately described than using conventional taxonomy, and it is easier for researchers to track the technology evolution in diferent aspects. We then present some discussions on developing responsible news recommender systems in Section 9, which is an emerging research ield in recent years. Finally, we raise several potential future directions and conclude this paper in Section 10.

## 2 FRAMEWORK OF PERSONALIZED NEWS RECOMMENDATION

Personalized news recommendation techniques have been widely used in many online news websites [144,223].Diferent from non-personalized news recommendation methods that suggest news articles solely based onnon-personalized factors [100] such as news popularity [27,127,130,227], editors’ demonstration [199] andgeographic information [21,178], personalized news recommendation can consider the personal interest of eachindividual user to provide personalized news services and better satisfy users’ need.

Existing surveys on personalized news recommendation usually classify methods into three categories, i.e.,collaborative iltering-based, content-based and hybrid [113]. However, this taxonomy cannot adapt to therecent advances in news recommendation because many methods with diverse characteristics fall in the samecategory without distinguishment. For example, the category of content-based methods includes traditionalsemantic-based methods, contextual bandit-based methods and recent deep learning-based methods, which isdiicult to characterize the paradigm and technical evolution of personalized news recommendation. Thus, amore systematic overview of existing techniques is required to help understand the development of this field.

Instead of following the conventional taxonomy, in this survey we propose a novel perspective to reviewexisting personalized news recommendation techniques based on the core problems involved in the developmentof a personalized news recommender system. A common framework of personalized news recommendationmodel development is shown in Fig. 2. We can see that there are several key problems in this framework.First, news modeling is the backbone of news recommendation and a core problem is how to understand thecontent and characteristics of news. In addition, user modeling is required to understand the personal interestof users in news, and it is critical to accurately infer user interest from user proiles like behaviors. Based onthe news and user representations built by the news and user models, the next step is ranking candidate newsaccording to certain policies such as the relevance between news and user interest. Then, it is important totrain the recommendation model with proper objectives to make high-quality news recommendations, andevaluating the ranking results given by the recommendation model is also a core problem in the development ofpersonalized recommender systems. Besides, the datasets and benchmarks for news recommendation are alsonecessities in designing personalized news recommendation models. Moreover, beyond developing accuratemodels, improving the responsibility of intelligent systems has been a spotlight problem in recent years. How todevelop responsible news recommender systems is a less studied but extremely important problem in personalizednews recommendation. Next, we briely discuss the key problems mentioned above in the following sections.

### 2.1 News Modeling

News modeling aims to understand the characteristics and content of news, which is the backbone of newsrecommendation. There are mainly two kinds of techniques for news modeling, i.e., feature-based news modelingand deep learning-based news modeling. Feature-based news modeling methods usually rely on handcraftedfeatures to represent news articles. For instance, in many methods based on collaborative iltering (CF), newsarticles are represented by their IDs [29,168]. However, on most news websites novel news articles are publishedcontinuously and old ones soon vanish. Thus, representing news articles with their IDs will sufer from severecold-start problems, and the performance is usually suboptimal.

Considering the drawbacks of ID-based news modeling methods, most approaches incorporate content featuresto represent news. Among them, many methods use features extracted from news texts for news modeling. Forinstance, Capelle et al. [16] proposed to represent news with Synset Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(SF-IDF), which uses WordNet synonym set to replace the term frequencies in TF-IDF. Besides the news texts,many methods also explore to incorporate various factors that may have inluence on users’ news browsingdecisions into news modeling, such as news popularity and recency [109]. However, in these methods, the featuresto represent news are usually manually designed, which usually requires much efort and domain knowledge. Inaddition, handcrafted features are usually not optimal in representing the semantic information encoded in newstexts.

With the development of natural language processing techniques in recent years, many methods employneural NLP models to learn deep representations of news. For example, Okura et al. [144] proposed to useautoencoders to learn news representations from news content. Wang et al. [197] proposed to use a knowledge-aware convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn news representations from news titles and their entities. Wuet al. [207] proposed to learn news representations from news titles via a combination of multi-head self-attentionand additive attention networks. Wu et al. [214] studied to use pre-trained language models to encode news texts.These deep learning-based news modeling methods can automatically learn informative news representationswithout heavy efort on manual feature engineering, and they can usually better understand news content thantraditional feature-based methods.

### 2.2 User Modeling

User modeling techniques in news recommendation aim to understand users’ personal interest in news. Similar tonews modeling, user modeling methods can also be roughly classiied into two categories, i.e., feature-based anddeep learning-based. Some feature-based methods like CF represent users with their IDs [29,168]. However, theyusually sufer from the sparsity of user data and cannot model user interest accurately. Thus, most feature-basedmethods consider other user information such as click behaviors on news. For example, Garcin et al. [52] proposedto use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract topics from the concatenation of news title, summary andbody. The topic vectors of all clicked news are further aggregated into a user vector by averaging. There are alsoseveral works that explore to incorporate other user features into user modeling, such as demographics [104],location [43] and access patterns [109]. However, feature-based user modeling methods also require an enormousamount of domain knowledge to design informative user features in speciic scenarios, and they are usuallysuboptimal in representing user interests.

There are several methods that use neural networks to learn user representations from users’ click behaviors.For example, Okura et al. [144] proposed to use a GRU network to learn user representations from clicked news.Wu et al. [204] proposed a personalized attention network to learn user representations from clicked news in apersonalized manner. Qi et al. [160] proposed a hierarchical user interest representation method to model thehierarchical structure of user interest. These methods can automatically learn deep interest representations ofusers for personalized news recommendation, which are usually more accurate than handcrafted user interestfeatures.

### 2.3 Personalized Ranking

On the basis of news and user interest modeling, the next step is ranking candidate news in a personalizedway according to user interest. Most methods rank news based on their relevance to user interest, and how toaccurately measure the relevance between user interest and candidate news is their core problem. Some methodsmeasure the user-news relevance based on their representations. For example, Goossen et al. [58] proposed tocompute the cosine similarity between the Concept Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (CF-IDF) featuresextracted from candidate news and clicked news, which was further used for personalized candidate newsranking. Okura et al. [144] used the inner product between news and user embeddings to compute the clickscores, and ranked candidate news based on these scores. Gershman et al. [55] proposed to use an SVM model foreach individual user to classify whether this user will click a candidate news based on news and user interestfeatures. In several recent methods, the relevance between candidate news and user interest is modeled in aine-grained way by matching candidate news with clicked news. For example, Wang et al. [196] proposed tomatch candidate news and clicked news with a 3-D convolutional neural network to mine the ine-grainedrelatedness between their content. However, ranking candidate news and user interest merely based on theirrelevance may recommend news that are similar to those previously clicked by users [160], which may cause thełilter bubble” problem.

A few methods use reinforcement learning for personalized ranking. Li et al. [106] irst explore to model thepersonalized news recommendation task as a contextual bandit problem. They proposed a LinUCB approach thatcomputes the upper conidence bound (UCB) of each arm eiciently in closed form based on a linear payof model,which can match news with users’ personal interest and meanwhile explore making diverse recommendations.DRN [244] uses a deep reinforcement learning approach to ind the interest matching policy that optimizes thelong-term reward. In addition, it uses a Dueling Bandit Gradient Descent (DBGD) method for exploration. Thesemethods usually optimize the long-term reward rather than the current click probability, which has the potentialto alleviate the ilter bubble problem by exploring more diverse user interest.

### 2.4 Model Training

Many personalized news recommendation methods employ machine learning models for news modeling, usermodeling and interest matching. How to train these models to make accurate recommendations is a criticalproblem. A few methods train their models by predicting the ratings on news given by users. For example, theGrouplens [168] system is trained by predicting the unknown ratings in the user-news matrix. However, explicitfeedback such as ratings is usually sparse on news platforms. Thus, most existing methods use implicit feedbacklike clicks to construct prediction targets for model training. For example, Wang et al. [197] formulated the newsclick prediction problem as a binary classiication task, and use crossentropy as the loss function for modeltraining. Wu et al. [204] proposed to employ negative sampling techniques that combine each positive samplewith several negative samples to construct labeled samples for model training. However, click feedback usuallycontains heavy noise and may not indicate user interest, which poses great challenges to learning accuraterecommendation models.

There are only a few methods that consider user feedback beyond click signals [213,215]. For example,Wu et al. [213] proposed to model click preference with click feedback and model reading satisfaction basedon the personalized reading speed of users, and train the recommendation model to predict both clicks anduser satisfaction. By optimizing objectives beyond news clicks, these methods are aware of user engagementinformation and thereby can better understand user interest. In addition, these methods have the potential torecommend news articles that are not only clicked by users, but also indeed satisfy their information needs. Thus,designing engagement-aware training objectives is useful for news recommender systems to provide high-qualitynews suggestions.

### 2.5 Evaluation

Properly evaluating the performance of personalized news recommendation algorithms is important for devel-oping real-world news recommender systems. Most existing methods use click-related metrics to measure theaccuracy of recommendation results. Some of them regard the recommendation task as a classiication prob-lem [70,116,197], where the performance is evaluated by classiication metrics such as Area Under Curve (AUC)and F1-score. Many other methods use ranking metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and normalized Dis-counted Cummulative Gain (nDCG). However, click-based metrics may not indicate user experience. Thus, a fewworks explore to use user engagement-based metrics to evaluate the recommendation performance [215], such asdwell time and dislike, which can evaluate the performance of recommendation models more comprehensively.In most works, the performance of recommendation models is oline evaluated. However, the data used foroline evaluation is usually inluenced by the recommendation results generated by the predecessor recommen-dation algorithms, and the real user feedback on recommendation results cannot be obtained. Only a few worksreported online evaluation results [214], which may better indicate the real performance of the recommendersystems. To ill the gaps between oline and online experiments, one prior study [107] proposed an unbiasedevaluation method of contextual bandit-based news recommendation methods. However, there still lacks a generalmethod that can oline evaluate the potentials of various news recommender algorithms in online environments.

### 2.6 Dataset and Benchmark

Publicly available datasets are important for facilitating researches in the corresponding ields as well as bench-marking their results and indings. However, in the personalized news recommendation ield most researches areconducted on proprietary datasets collected from diferent news platforms, such as Google News, Microsoft News,Yahoo News, Bing News, etc. There are only a few datasets that are publicly available for news recommendationresearch. Several representative datasets such as plista [91], Adressa [61] and MIND [223] are widely used byrecent studies. The plista dataset is a German news dataset. A newer version of this dataset is published by the CLEF 2017 NewsREEL [126] task, and a competition is held based on this data to train and evaluate newsrecommender systems. Adressa is a Norwegian dataset that contains not only click information, but also the dwelltime of users and rich context information of users and news. MIND is a large-scale English news recommendationdataset with raw textual information of news. In addition, MIND is associated with a public leaderboard andan open competition, which can fairly compare the performance of diferent algorithms. Thus, many recentresearches are conducted on the MIND dataset [210, 214, 218].

### 2.7 Responsible News Recommendation

Most endeavors on personalized news recommendation focus on improving the accuracy of recommendationresults. In recent years, research on the responsibility of machine intelligent systems has gained high attentionto help AI techniques better serve humans and avoid their risky and even harmful behaviors that can lead tonegative societal impacts and unethical consequences [36]. There are many aspects to improve the responsibilityof personalized news recommender systems [5]. For example, since many news recommendation methods arelearned on private user data, it is important to protect user privacy in recommendation model training and onlineserving [159]. Federated learning [137] is a privacy-aware machine learning paradigm, which can empowerthe construction of privacy-preserving news recommender systems. Besides optimizing news recommendationaccuracy, it is also important to promote the diversity of news recommendation results, which can satisfy users’needs on information variety and alleviate the ilter bubble problem [65,164,166,212]. Moreover, fairness isa critical aspect of responsible news recommendation, since the recommendation models learned on biaseduser data may inherit unwanted biases, which may lead to the prejudice of algorithms and further unfairrecommendation results. To mitigate the unfairness issue of news recommendation methods, fairness-awaremachine learning techniques [221] can help build inclusive and fair algorithms to provide high-quality newsrecommendation services to diferent groups of users. These research ields on responsible news recommendationemerging in recent years have the potential to improve the quality of news recommender systems to serve usersin a more responsible way. However, there lacks a systematic review on responsible news recommendation inexisting survey papers. In this survey, we irst give a comprehensive review on the frontiers of responsible newsrecommendation research.

Given the overview above, we then present in-depth discussions on each mentioned core problem in thefollowing sections.

## 3 NEWS MODELING

News modeling is a critical step in personalized news recommendation methods to capture the characteristicsof news articles and understand their content. The techniques for news modeling can be roughly divided intotwo categories, i.e., feature-based and deep learning-based. For feature-based methods, news articles are mainlyrepresented by handcrafted features, while deep learning-based methods mainly aim to learn hidden newsrepresentations from the raw inputs. Note that although a few methods may employ some deep learning methodslike multi-layer perceptrons to model interactions between sophisticated handcrafted features, we still categorizethem into feature-based ones because their news representations are not learned from scratch. In addition, somedeep learning-based methods may involve some eforts in feature engineering. Since their news representationmethods mainly focus on incorporating additional features to enhance deep representations learned from scratch,we still put them into the deep learning-based category. The details of the two types of news modeling methodsare as introduced follows.

<img src="https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/a867894db8f9d544a471e86d8844008861f6a2ec/9-Figure3-1.png">

Fig. 3. An overview of different types of news features.

### 3.1 Feature-based News Modeling

Designing informative features to represent news articles is the key problem in feature-based news modelingmethods. As summarized in Fig. 2, there are mainly four types of features used in news modeling, which areintroduced as follows.

In many CF-based methods, news articles are represented by collaborative iltering signals such as newsIDs [29,62,78,141,168,172,225]. However, on most news websites novel news are published quickly and oldones will soon vanish. These methods model news in a content-agnostic manner, which may sufer from theserious cold start problem due to the diiculty in processing newly generated news. Thus, it is not suitable tosimply represent news articles with their IDs [37].

Due to the drawbacks of ID-based news modeling, many methods incorporate news content into news modeling.For instance, Gershman et al. [55] considered Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) featuresextracted from news texts. In news articles, entities/concepts are usually more important than other words inunderstanding news content. Thus, many methods use the entities/concepts in news texts to represent theircontent. For example, Goossen et al. [58] proposed to use Concept Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(CF-IDF) to model news content, which is a variant of TF-IDF that uses the frequency of concepts extracted fromWordNet rather than term frequency. Capelle et al. [16] proposed to use Synset FrequencyśInverse DocumentFrequency (SF-IDF) to model news, which is based on the frequency of synonym sets in WordNet. SF-IDF isextended by Moerland et al. [140] into SF-IDF+ by additionally considering the relationships of concepts. Theyextend the synonym sets of concepts in news by adding other concepts in WordNet that have relationships withthe included concepts. Based on aforementioned approaches, the family of CF-IDF is expanded by a set of laterworks [11, 18, 30, 67, 68].

Besides semantic features, some works explore to extract other kinds of content features to enhance model-ing [104,109,147]. For example, Garcin et al. [52] proposed to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extracttopics from the concatenation of news title, summary and main content. Parizi et al. [147] proposed to extractemotion features of sentences in news as complementary information of TF-IDF features. In their method, theemotion is represented by the Ekman model that contains 6 emotion categories. A variant of this method thatuses the sentiment orientation (i.e., positive, neutral and negative) is also developed by Parizi et al. [148]. Beyondnews texts, the exploitation of vision-related information such as the videos of news is also studied in [131].These features can provide complementary information to better understand news content.

In addition to content features, many other genres of features are used for news modeling. They can be roughlydivided into two categories, i.e., property features and context features. Property features such as categories,locations and publishers usually relect intrinsic properties of news. The most widely used news property featureis category, since it is an important clue for modeling news content and targeting user interest. For example,Liu et al. [122] proposed to represent news using their topic categories. However, since the category labelsof news often need to be manually annotated by editors, in some scenarios news may not have of-the-shelf category labels, Thus, several methods explore to cluster news into categories based on their content. For instance,in the SCENE [109] recommender system, news articles are clustered in a hierarchical manner based on theirtopic features extracted by LDA. By incorporating the categories or clusters of news into news modeling, thenews recommender can be aware of news topics and provide more targeted recommendation services. Anotherrepresentative property feature is news location, which is also widely used to provide users with the news relatedto the locations that they are interested in. For example, Tavakolifard et al. [187] incorporated the geographicinformation of news to ilter news based on their locations. In addition, since news from diferent publishersmay have diferences in their content and topics, the information of news publisher is also considered by severalmethods to enrich the information for news modeling [75, 117].

Diferent from property features that are usually static after news publishing, context features of news aredynamic. Popularity and recency, which relect the attractiveness and freshness of news, are two representativecontext features used by existing methods. For instance, MONERS [104] is a news recommender system thatrepresents news articles by news categories, news importance suggested by providers and the recency of newsarticles. Gershman et al. [55] proposed to use four kinds of features to represent news, i.e., news popularity,news age (recency), TF-IDF features of words and named entities. Jonnalagedda et al. [82] proposed to use thetimeline on Twitter to enhance news modeling. They use the popularity and categories of news on Twitter fornews representation. News recency only considers the time interval between the publishing and display of news,while time stamp of news display can provide iner-grained information, such as seasons, months, days and thetime in a day. Thus, several approaches incorporate the time stamp of news impression [25,41,43,75,225]. Forexample, Ilievski et al. [75] proposed to incorporate the weekday and the hour of a news impression in newsmodeling. In addition to the context features mentioned above, several methods also explore to use weather [229],click-through rate (CTR) [25], and fact/opinion bias [150] to enrich the representations of news.

Some hybrid methods consider both news IDs and additional features in news modeling [125]. For example,NewsWeeder [99] represents news articles by their IDs and bag-of-word features. Claypool et al. [26] proposedto use news IDs and keywords to model news. Liu et al. [122] proposed to represent news using their IDsand topic categories. Saranya et al. [171] proposed to represent news by their IDs, topics, click frequencyand the weights of a news belonging to diferent categories. Using the combination of ID-based and content-based news modeling techniques can mitigate the cold-start problem of news to some extent, and have beenwidely explored by integrating other information like news property features [28,202], news sessions [182],ontology [15, 48, 142, 163, 173] and knowledge graphs [236].

To draw a big picture of feature-based news modeling methods, we summarize the major features they used in Table 2.

### 3.2 Deep learning-based News Modeling

With the development of deep learning techniques, in recent years many methods employ neural networksto automatically learn news representations. Instead of using handcrafted features like TF-IDF to representnews content, most of them use neural NLP techniques to learn news representations from news texts. Forexample, Okura et al. [144] proposed an embedding-based news recommendation (EBNR) method that uses avariant of denoising autoencoders to learn news representations from news texts. RA-DSSM [96] is a neuralnews recommendation approach which incorporates a similar architecture as DSSM [72]. It irst builds therepresentations of news using the doc2vec [102] tool, then uses a two-layer neural network to learn hidden newsrepresentations. This method is also adopted by [97]. 3-D-CNN [98] represents news by the word2vec [139]embeddings of their words, which is further considered by [242]. However, it is diicult for these methods tomine the semantic information in news texts with traditional neural NLP models.

Many later approaches use more advanced neural NLP models for text modeling, such as CNN [196,239] andself-attention [207]. For instance, WE3CN [90] uses 2D CNN models to learn representations of news. NPA [204]uses CNN to generate contextual representations of words in news titles, and use a personalized attentionnetwork to form news representations by selecting important words in a personalized manner. NRMS [207] learnsword representations with a multi-head self-attention network, and uses an additive attention network to formnews representations. Similar news modeling method is also used by many later works [212,213,215,218,221].NRNF [209] uses self-attention to model the contexts of words in news title and body, and it uses an interactiveattention network to model the relatedness between title and body. A similar co-attention mechanism is usedby [136] to model the interactions between news title and abstract. FedRec [158] learns news representations fromnews titles via a combination of CNN and multi-head self-attention networks. These methods usually learn newsrepresentations based on shallow text models and non-contextualized word embeddings such as GloVe [151],which may be insuicient to capture the deep semantic information in news. WG4Rec [176] introduces a word-graph based news text modeling method. It constructs a word graph based on semantic similarity, co-occurrenceand news co-click, and learns word embeddings through a GNN model. These methods can enhance news textunderstanding with various neural architectures. However, these models are still rather shallow and may not bestrong enough in capturing the deep semantic information in news texts.

In recent years, big and powerful pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as BERT [34] have been greatlysuccessful in NLP, and a few recent works explore to empower news modeling with PLMs [81,165,214,222,224,231,240,241]. For example, PLM-NR [214] uses diferent PLMs to empower English and multilingual newsrecommendation, and the online light results in Microsoft News showed notable performance improvement.UNBERT [241] incorporates the concatenation of news texts as the input of a BERT model. The indings in theseworks imply the efectiveness of large PLMs in empowering text understanding in news recommendation.

Instead of merely modeling semantic information in news texts, several methods study to use entities orkeywords in news texts to enhance news modeling by introducing complementary knowledge and commonsenseinformation. A direct way is regarding entities as texts and combining them with news text modeling [79]. Forinstance, Gao et al. [49] proposed a knowledge-aware news recommendation approach with hierarchical attentionnetworks. In their method, a word attention network is used to learn word-based news representations by usingthe embeddings of keywords as attention queries, and these representations are concatenated with both entityembeddings and the average embeddings of the entities in their contexts. An item attention network is usedto aggregate these three kinds of news representations by modeling their informativeness. DAN [248] learnsnews representations from news titles and entities via two parallel CNN networks with max pooling operations.Saskr [24] builds news representations from news titles and bodies based on the average word embeddings oftheir entities. DNA [235] learns news representations from the news body, news ID and the elements (entitiesand keywords). More speciically, the sentences in a news body are transformed into their embeddings viadoc2vec [102], and then are aggregated into a uniied one via a sentence-level candidate-aware attention network.Each news element is represented by averaging the embeddings of its words, and elements representations aresynthesized together via an element-level candidate-aware attention network. The embeddings of the ID, texts,and elements of each piece of news are concatenated together into a uniied news representation. HieRec [160]uses text self-attention and entity self-attention to model the contexts in news titles and the relations betweenentities in news texts, respectively. These methods can easily unify the use of texts and knowledge entities, butthey cannot efectively exploit the relatedness between entities.

Another way to exploit entity information is incorporating knowledge graph embeddings [119,175,185,190,197]. For example, DKN [197] learns news representations from the titles of news and the entities within titlesvia a knowledge-aware CNN. The representations of entities are learned from a knowledge graph using theTransD [77] knowledge graph embedding algorithm. Liu et al. [119] proposed to construct a news-relevantknowledge graph on the basis of the Microsoft Satori knowledge graph by extracting additional knowledgeentities and topic entities from news and connecting entities in the same news, entities clicked by the same userand entities appearing in the same browsing session to enrich the relations between entities in the knowledgegraph. They combine the entity embeddings learned by TransE [9] with the news text embeddings learned byLDA and DSSM. CAGE [174,175] constructs subgraphs of KG by using one-hop neighbors of entities, and uses theTransE embeddings of entities as complements to text embeddings learned by CNN. However, these knowledgegraph embeddings mainly condense low-level interactions between entities. To enhance the modeling of richentity relatedness, TEKGR [103] enriches the knowledge graph with topical relations between entities. It predictsthe topic of news based on texts and concepts, and uses the predicted topic to enrich the knowledge graph andlearn topic enriched knowledge representations of news with graph neural networks. KRED [121] irst learnsentity embeddings from knowledge graph with graph attention networks, then incorporates additional entityfeatures such as frequency, category and position, and inally selects entities according to the texts representationsof news. KIM [156] incorporates a knowledge-aware interactive news modeling method that can model therelations between the entities and their neighbors of clicked news and candidate news through graph co-attentionnetworks. KOPRA [188] only uses the TransE embeddings of knowledge entities to represent news, and it uses arecurrent graph convolution network to learn hidden entity representations. These methods can encode richerknowledge information of news than pure text-based methods to empower news recommendation.

To better model the characteristics of news articles, several methods explore to incorporate other types of newsinformation beyond texts into news modeling. Among them, topic categories and tags are widely consideredby existing methods [63,149,203,205,237]. For example, DeepJoNN [237] learns news representations fromnews IDs, categories, keywords and entities via a character-level CNN. Park et al. [149] proposed a neural newsrecommendation method based on LSTM. They use a proprietary corpus to train a doc2vec [102] model to encodenews articles into their vector representations, and use an LSTM network to generate user representations from the representations of news. In addition, they incorporate the categories of news into news representations, whichare predicted by a CNN [93] model. TANR [205] learns news representation from news titles via a combinationof CNN and attention network, which is also used in [206,230]. Moreover, TANR incorporates an auxiliary newstopic prediction task to learn topic-aware news representations. NAML [203] is a news recommendation methodwith attentive multi-view learning, which incorporates diferent kinds of news information as diferent viewsof news. In this method, news titles, bodies, categories and subcategories are processed by diferent models,and their embeddings are further aggregated together into a uniied one via a view-level attention network. Asimilar method is also used by [210,243] to model candidate news. LSTUR [2] uses a combination of CNN andattention network to process news titles, and incorporates categories and subcategories by applying a non-lineartransformation to their embeddings. CHAMELEON [31,46] learns news representations from news bodies byusing CNN with diferent kernel sizes, and these textual representations are fused with news metadata featuressuch as topics, categories and tags using a fully connected layer. It also predicts the metadata features of news viaauxiliary tasks.

In addition to topical information, several methods consider other types of content information of news. Forexample, SentiRec [212] considers the sentiment orientation of news to learn sentiment-aware news representa-tions. It uses the VADER [73] algorithm to compute real-valued sentiment scores of news. MM-Rec [217] uses avisiolinguistic model ViLBERT [128] to learn news multi-modal representations from both news texts and images.IMRec [226] models the rich visual impression information of news such as texts, image regions, the arrangementof diferent ields, and spatial positions of diferent words on the impression. These methods can usually learnmore accurate news representations by characterizing their content in multiple aspects.

Another major group of additional information is context features, such as popularity and positions. Forexample, PP-Rec [157] uses both news title, entities and news popularity information in news modeling. It usesgating mechanisms to synthesize the near-real-time CTR, recency and popularity predicted from news title intoa uniied news popularity score. TSHGNN [80] incorporates the active time of users on a news page into themodeling of news texts. DCAN [138] uses the time from news publishing and near-real-time CTR to modelthe current positions of news articles in their lifecycles. CTX [23] studies the exploitation of CTR, Popularity,and Freshness features. The results show that these context features may even have a stronger impact thanpersonalized interest signals on click prediction. DebiasRec [230] uses CNN and attention network to learn newscontent representations from news titles, and learns news bias representations from the size and positions of newsdisplayed on websites with a bias model. These methods can usually better understand users’ interaction patternswith news by incorporating additional context information. However, some news features (e.g., near-real-timeCTR) may not be available in some real-world news recommender systems, which hinders the exploitation ofthese features.

There are a few methods that learn news representations from graphs. For example, IGNN [161] usesKCNN [197] to learn text-based news representations from news titles, and learn graph-based news representa-tions from the user-news graph. GERL [53] learns news title representations with a combination of multi-headself-attention and additive attention networks, and combines title representations with the embeddings of newscategories. MVL [170] uses a content view to incorporate news title, body and category, and uses a graph view toenhance news representations with their neighbors on the user-news graph. In addition, it uses a graph attentionnetwork to enhance representations of news by incorporating the information of their irst- and second-orderneighbors on the user-news graph. GNUD [71] uses the same news encoder as DAN to learn text-based newsrepresentations, and uses a graph convolution network (GCN) with a preference disentanglement regularizationto learn disentangled news representations on user-news graphs. In addition to the user-news graphs used by theabove methods, a few methods incorporate heterogeneous graphs that condense richer collaborative informa-tion [70,133,167]. For example, GNewsRec [70] is a hybrid approach which considers graph information of usersand news as well as news topic categories. It also uses the same architecture with DAN to learn text-based news representations, and uses a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) to learn graph-based news representationsfrom a heterogeneous user-news-topic graph. These methods can exploit the high-order information on graphsto enhance news modeling. However, it is diicult for these methods to handle newly generated news with fewconnections to existing nodes on the old graph used for training.

To help better understand the relatedness and diferences between the methods reviewed above, we summarizethe information and models they used for learning news representations in Table 3. Next, we provide severaldiscussions on the aforementioned methods for news modeling.

### 3.3 Discussions on News Modeling

#### 3.3.1 Feature-based News Modeling.

In feature-based news modeling methods, mining textual information ofnews is critical for representing news content. Many methods incorporate BOW/TF-IDF features or their variantsto represent news texts, which are also popular in the NLP ield. In addition, topic models like LDA are employedby various methods to extract topics from texts. This is probably because topic models are capable of miningthe topic distributions of news articles and can also provide useful clues for inferring user interest on diferenttopics. Moreover, since users may focus more on the entities or keywords in news, they are considered by manymethods to summarize the content and topic of news, and can also be useful links to ind similar news or mapnews on knowledge graphs. Especially, some methods also use ontology such as Wikipedia to extract entityfeatures to represent them more accurately.

Besides the texts of news, many methods utilize other information of news. For instance, the categories orclusters of news are popular news features to help model news content. In addition, several dynamic features ofnews are also widely employed in feature-based news modeling methods, such as popularity and recency. Sincemany users may pay more attention to popular events and news usually vanish quickly, incorporating newspopularity and recency can help build more informative news representations. Besides, several environmentalfactors, such as locations and time are also utilized by several methods. This is because considering locations ofnews can provide news related to users’ neighbors, and using the timestamps of news may be useful for providingtime-aware news services.

A few methods also study incorporating other interesting features. For example, the sentiment information ofnews is useful for news understanding, because users may have diferent tastes on the sentiment of news. Thebias of news may also need to be taken into consideration, because recommending news with biased opinions andfacts may hurt user experience and the reputation of news platforms. Finally, although several non-personalizednews recommendation methods have used news images to build news representations [127], few personalizedones consider the visual information of news, which is very useful for news modeling.

Although feature-based news modeling methods have comprehensive coverage of various news information,they usually require a large amount of domain knowledge for feature design. In addition, handcrafted featuresare usually not optimal in representing the textual content of news due to the absence of the contexts and ordersof words.

Table 3. Comparison of different methods on news modeling.

#### 3.3.2 Deep Learning-based News Modeling.

Among all the reviewed methods, only two methods, i.e., DNA [235]and DeepJoNN [237], directly incorporate the embeddings of news IDs. This is probably because of the shortlifecycle of news articles and the quick generation of novel news, which make the coverage of news IDs in thetraining set very limited. Thus, it is very important to understand news from their content.

News text modeling is critical for news understanding. Most methods use news titles to model news sincenews titles, because news titles usually have decisive inluence on users’ click behaviors. Several methods such asEBNR [144], NAML [203] and CPRS [213] use news bodies to enhance news representations, since news bodiesare contain more detailed information of news. In existing methods, CNN is the most frequently used architecturefor text modeling. This is because local contexts in news articles are important for modeling news content, and CNN is efective and eicient in capturing local contexts. In addition, since diferent news informationmay have diferent informativeness in modeling news content and user interest, attention mechanisms are alsowidely used to build news representations by selecting important features. With the success of Transformerin NLP, many methods also use Transformer-like architectures for news modeling, such as NRMS [207] andCPRS [213]. In addition, a few methods use pre-trained language or and visiolinguistic models to empower newsmodeling [214,217]. These advanced NLP techniques can greatly improve news content understanding, whichis very important for personalized news recommendation. However, these methods mainly aim to capture thesemantic information of news and may not be aware of the knowledge and commonsense information encodedin news.

To address this issue, many methods incorporate news entities into news modeling to learn knowledge-awarenews representations [120]. Some methods such as DAN [248] directly use entity texts to represent entities,while several other methods like DKN [197] use knowledge graph embeddings to represent entities. These entityrepresentations are usually combined with representations learned from news texts to better model news content.However, there are many new entities and concepts emerging in news and it may be diicult to accuratelyrepresent them with of-the-shelf knowledge bases.

Several methods incorporate the topic categories of news into news modeling, because news topics are veryuseful for understanding news content and inferring user interest. Considering the scenarios that some newsarticles are not labeled with topic categories, some methods such as TANR [205] and CHAMELEON [46] alsoadopt auxiliary tasks by predicting news topic categories to encode topic information into news representations.In addition, a few methods study using other kinds of news features such as sentiment [212], popularity [23],recency [157], which can help better understand the characteristics of news. However, some additional newsfeatures (e.g., category and CTR) may be unavailable in certain scenarios, which limits the application of thesemethods.

There are also a few methods that explore to enhance news modeling with graph information [53,70].These methods can incorporate the high-order information on user-news bipartite graphs [53,71,161,170] ormore complicated heterogeneous graphs [70,167], which can provide useful contexts on understanding thecharacteristics of news for news recommendation. However, since the graphs used in these methods are static,they may have some diiculties in accurately representing newly published news.

In summary, by reviewing news modeling techniques used in existing news recommendation methods, we cansee that news modeling is still a quite challenging problem in news recommendation due to the variety, dynamic,and timeliness of online news information.

## 4 USER MODELING

<img src="https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/a867894db8f9d544a471e86d8844008861f6a2ec/17-Figure4-1.png">

Fig. 4. An example framework of user modeling.

User modeling is also a critical step in personalized news recommender systems to infer users’ personal interestsin news. It is usually important for user modeling algorithms to understand users from their behaviors [205]. Anexample user modeling framework in personalized news recommendation is shown in Fig. 4. We can see thatuser modeling is based on the modeling of news that users have interactions with, and it introduces additionaluser features to achieve better personalized user understanding. The techniques for user modeling in existingnews recommendation methods can also be classiied into feature-based ones and deep learning-based ones.Feature-based user modeling techniques mainly rely on manually designed user modeling rules or heuristicpatterns to represent user interest. By contrast, deep learning-based methods usually focus on automaticallyinding useful patterns from user behaviors to infer user interest. The details of the two kinds of user modelingmethods are introduced in the following sections.

### 4.1 Feature-based User Modeling

Feature-based user modeling methods use handcrafted features to represent users. Similar to news modeling, inCF-based methods users are also represented by their IDs [29, 168]. However, ID-based user modeling methodsusually sufer from the data sparsity. Thus, most methods consider the behaviors of users such as news clicks tomodel their interest. An intuitive way is to use the features of clicked news to build user features. For example,Goossen et al. [58] used the CF-IDF features of clicked news to represent user interest. Capelle et al. [16] proposedto use the SF-IDF features of clicked news for user modeling. Garcin et al. [52] proposed to model users byaggregating the LDA features of all clicked news into a user vector by averaging. However, it is diicult for thesemethods to model users accurately when their news click behaviors are sparse.

Besides news features, many methods consider other supplementary information of users in user modeling.For instance, in the MONERS [104] recommender system, users are clustered into segments, and the preferencesof user segments on news categories and news articles are used to represent users. In addition, the demographicsof users, such as age, gender and profession, are also useful information for user modeling because users indiferent demographic groups usually have diferent preferences on news. Thus, user demographic features areincorporated by several methods [75, 104, 229]. For instance, Yeung et al. [229] proposed to use the age, gender,occupation status and social economic grade of users to help identify their diferent preferences on news indiferent categories. Chu et al. [25] used the age and gender categories of users to model their characteristics.Besides, the location information of users is also very useful for accurate user modeling, and it has been usedby several location-aware news recommendation methods [43,143]. However, some kinds of user features suchas locations and demographics are privacy-sensitive, and many users may not provide their accurate personalinformation.

Since news clicks may not necessarily indicate user interests, several methods also consider other kinds of userbehaviors or feedback. For example, Gershman et al. [55] proposed to represent users by the news they carefullyread (regarded as positive news), rejected, and scrolled (both are regarded as negative news). In addition, users’dwell time on clicked news is also an important indication of user interest, and Yi et al. [232] studied to use dwelltime as the weights of clicked news for user modeling. Besides these user behaviors, several other kinds of user behavior information such as access patterns, are utilized by a few methods [109,171] to capture the users’ habitson news reading.

Several methods also consider graph information (e.g., news-user graphs) in user modeling [56]. For example, Liet al. [108] proposed a news personalization method by using hypergraph to model various high-order interactionsbetween diferent news information, where users are represented by subgraphs of the hypergraph. Garcin etal. [50] proposed to use context trees for user modeling. They constructed context trees based on the sequence ofarticles, the sequence of topics and the distribution of topics. Trevisiol et al. [192] proposed to build a browsinggraph from the news browsing histories of users on Yahoo News. Joseph et al. [84] proposed to represent usersby regarding the clicked news as subgraphs of a knowledge graph, which are constructed via entity linking.These methods can consider the high-order information on graphs to help understand user behaviors, which canimprove user modeling.

A few methods combine user IDs with other user features in user modeling [125]. For example, NewsWeeder [99]used user IDs and the bag-of-words features of clicked news to represent users. Claypool et al. [26] used user IDsand keywords of clicked news for user modeling Liu et al. [122] proposed to represent users using their IDs anduser interest features predicted by a Bayesian model. These methods can mitigate the drawbacks of ID-baseduser modeling and meanwhile incorporate useful personal information encoded by user IDs.

Considering the evolutionary characteristics of user interest, some methods model both long-term and short-term user interests [15,112]. NewsDude [7] may be one of the earliest methods that consider long short-termuser interests. In this approach, users are represented by a hybrid model, which models short-term interest ofusers based on recently browsed news, and models long-term user interest by sorting words of news in eachcategory with respect to their TF-IDF values and selecting the top ranked words. Li et al. [111] proposed LOGO,which is a news recommendation method that models both long-term and short-term user interests. LOGO usesa weighted summation of the topic distributions of news clicked by users to indicate long-term user interest, andit uses the topic distribution of the latest clicked news as the short-term user interest. Viana et al. [193] proposedanother news recommendation method based on long short-term user interest. In their method, the long-terminterest of users is represented by the frequency of a speciic tag being read by this user, and short-term interestis represented by several recently clicked news. Diferent from other methods that only consider short-termor long-term user interests, these methods can better model the evolution of user interests by capturing longshort-term user interests.

To help readers better understand feature-based user modeling methods in personalized news recommendersystems, we summarize the additional user features (ID and news features are excluded) used in these methods in Table 4.

### 4.2 Deep Learning-based User Modeling

<img src="https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/a867894db8f9d544a471e86d8844008861f6a2ec/19-Table4-1.png">

Table 4. Additional features used for user representation. \*ID/textual features of clicked news are excluded because they are incorporated by most methods.

In recent years, many personalized news recommendation methods use deep learning techniques for usermodeling to remove the need of manual feature engineering. Most existing methods infer user interests fromhistorical news click behaviors. Several methods focus on aggregating the representations of historical clickednews [63]. For example, Khattar et al. [97] used the summation of clicked news representations weighted by anexponential discounting function, where more recent clicks gain higher weights. NAML [203] and KRED [121]learn user representations from the representations of clicked news using a news-level attention network, andAMM [240] also uses attention network to aggregate diferent information of clicked news and candidate news foruser modeling. DKN [197] learns user representations from the representations of clicked news via a candidate-aware attention network, i.e., computing the attention weight of each clicked news according to its relevance tocandidate news. The candidate-aware attention mechanism is also used by TEKGR [103] for user modeling. Liuet al. [119] use a simple time-decayed averaging of the embeddings of clicked news to build the user embedding.MM-Rec [217] uses a crossmodal candidate-aware attention network that selects clicked news based on theircrossmodal relatedness with candidate news for user modeling. HieRec [160] uses a hierarchical user interestrepresentation method that irst models subtopic-level user interest from the news within the same subtopic, thenaggregates subtopic-level interest representations into coarse-grained topic-level user interest representations,and inally synthesizes topic-level interest representations into an over interest representation. DebiasRec [230]uses a bias-aware user modeling module to learn debiased user interest representations by incorporating theinluence of presentation bias information on click behaviors into attentive behavior aggregation. These methodscan select important click behaviors for user modeling. However, the relations among diferent clicked news,which provide rich contexts of behaviors that are useful to user modeling, cannot be modeled by these methods.

Therefore, many methods consider the contexts of news click behaviors. Recurrent neural network (RNN)is a popular choice to model the sequential dependency between diferent clicked news [96,144,165,248]. Forexample, EBNR [144] learns representations of users from the representations of their browsed news via a GRUnetwork. RA-DSSM [96] uses a bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network to process the historicalnews click sequence, and then use a news-level attention network to form a user representation. DAN [248] learnsuser representations from clicked news using a combination of attentive LSTM and candidate-aware attention,which generate user historical sequential embedding and user interest embedding, respectively. The advantage ofRNN-based user models is their strong ability in modeling user interest dynamics. However, they are somewhatweak in capturing the global interest information of users. In addition, as pointed by [216], news recommendationmay not be suitable to be modeled as a conventional sequential recommendation problem because users have astrong preference on the diversity between past and future clicked news.

Many other common deep models, such as CNN [239], self-attention [207] and co-attention [138], havealso been applied in user modeling. For example, WE3CN [90] learns representations of users from the 3Drepresentation tensors of their clicked news using a 3D CNN model. SFI [138] further introduces a hard selectionmechanism to reduce the computational cost in 3D CNN-based user modeling. NRMS [207] learns contextual newsrepresentations by using a news-level multi-head self-attention network, and uses an additive attention networkto form the user representation. This method is also adopted by many methods like FairRec [221], IMRec [226] andSentiRec [212], and the variant that uses łCLS” token representation of Transformer is used by [241]. FIM [196]uses a ine-grained interest modeling method that can capture the word-level relatedness between news witha 3D CNN model. UniRec [218] learns the user embedding for news ranking with the NRMS [207] model, andthen uses this embedding as the attention query to select a set of basis interest embeddings to aggregate theminto a user embedding for news recall. KIM [156] uses a user-news co-encoder that models the interactionsbetween candidate news and clicked news to collaboratively learn a candidate-aware user interest representationand a user-aware candidate news representation. PP-Rec [157] uses a popularity-aware user modeling method that irst uses self-attention to model the contexts of user behaviors and then uses a content-popularity jointattention network that selects clicked news according to their content and popularity for user interest modeling.RMBERT [81] uses a reasoning memory network [45] to capture the sophisticated interactions between userbehaviors and candidate news in user interest modeling. These methods can efectively capture the relations ofdiferent user behaviors to enhance user modeling.

In recent years, graph neural networks have also been applied to model the contexts of user behaviors bycapturing their high-order relations [136]. For example, CAGE [175] irst uses a GCN model to capture therelations between diferent behaviors within a news session to reine the behavior representations, and thenuses a GRU network to build user representations. User-as-Graph [210] is probably the irst work in newsrecommendation that represents each user with a personalized heterogeneous graph constructed from clickbehaviors, where the user modeling task is modeled as a graph pooling problem. It uses a heterogeneous graphpooling method named HG-Pool to iteratively summarize the personalized heterogeneous graph for learning userinterest representations. EEG [243] models each user as an entity graph. It irst uses a graph neural network tolearn hidden entity representations, and then uses an attention network to aggregate them into an entity-baseduser representation. KOPRA [188] also models users as entity graphs and uses recurrent graph convolution toprocess the entity graphs. It models both long-term and short-term user interests with the entire graph and thesubgraph inferred from recently clicked news, respectively. In addition, it introduces an entity neighbor pruningtechnique to select entity neighbors according to user interests. CNE-SUE [136] applies a GCN to diferentsubgraphs of an entire user behavior graph to learn diferent interest representations for diferent behaviorclusters. It further employs an intra-cluster attention mechanism to pool node representations and uses anintra-cluster attention mechanism to aggregate cluster representations. These methods can usually capture therich high-order relatedness between users’ click behaviors to discover latent user interest.

In addition to click behaviors, a few methods also consider the ID information of users [235,237]. For exam-ple, NPA [204] uses a news-level personalized attention network to select important news according to usercharacteristics, where the embeddings of user IDs are used to generate the attention queries. LSTUR [2] learnsshort-term user interest embeddings by a GRU network, and models long-term user interests by the embeddingsof user IDs. To fuse the two kinds of user representations, LSTUR explores two methods, i.e., concatenating twovectors together, or using the long-term user interest embedding to initialize the hidden state of the GRU network.This framework is further used by CUPMAR [190] and KG-LSTUP [185]. These methods can usually better serveactive users with rich behaviors to tune their ID embeddings. However, they have some diiculties in handlingcold-start users without well-tuned user embeddings.

All the aforementioned methods mainly rely on the information of users’ click behaviors. However, clickbehaviors are very noisy and may not necessarily indicate user interest, and it is diicult to comprehensively andaccurately infer user interest from click feedback only. Thus, a few methods study incorporating other kindsof user information to enhance user interest modeling [238]. One major direction is adding context features toenhance user modeling. For example, CHAMELEON [31,46] uses several user context features like time, device,location and referrer. It uses a UGRNN network to learn representations of users in a session, and the click scoreis evaluated by the cosine similarity between user and candidate news representations. The context features usedin these methods can provide rich information for inferring users’ current preferences to improve subsequentnews recommendation.

Another main direction is incorporating various kinds of user behaviors [133]. For example, NRHUB [206]considers heterogeneous user behaviors, including news clicks, search queries, and browsed webpages. It incor-porates diferent kinds of user behaviors as diferent views of users by learning a user embedding from eachkind of user behaviors separately, where a combination of CNN and attention network is used to learn behaviorrepresentations and a behavior attention network is used to learn a user embedding by selecting important userbehaviors. The user embeddings from diferent views are aggregated into a uniied one via a view attention network. The efectiveness of webpage browsing behaviors in user modeling for news recommendation is alsostudied by WG4Rec [176]. CPRS [213] considers users’ click and reading behaviors in user modeling. It modelsthe click preference of users from the titles of clicked news, and models their reading satisfaction from thebody of clicked news as well as the personalized reading speed metric derived from dwell time and body length.NRNF [209] uses a dwell time threshold to divide click news into positive ones and negative ones. It uses separateTransformers and attention networks to learn positive and negative user interest representations. FeedRec [215]uses various kinds of user feedback including click, nonclick, inish, quick close, share and dislike to model userinterest. It uses a heterogeneous Transformer to model the relatedness between all kinds of feedback and usesdiferent homogeneous Transformers to model the interactions between the same kind of feedback. In addition, ituses a strong-to-weak attention network that uses the representations of strong feedback to distill real positiveand negative user interest information from weak feedback. These methods can usually infer user interests moreaccurately by mining complementary information encoded in multiple kinds of user behaviors.

There are also several methods that learn user representations on graphs that involve the collaborativeinformation of users and news. For example, IGNN [161] learns content-based user representations using theaverage embedding of clicked news, and learns graph-based user representations from the user-news graphvia a graph neural network. The content-based user representation is concatenated with graph-based userrepresentation to form a uniied one. GNewsRec [70] uses the same architecture with DAN to learn short-term userrepresentations, and uses a two-layer graph neural network (GNN) to learn long-term user representations froma heterogeneous user-news-topic graph. Both short-term and long-term user representations are concatenated tobuild a uniied user representation. GERL [53] uses multi-head self-attention and additive attention networks toform content-based user representations from the click history. In addition, it uses a graph attention network tolearn graph-based representations of users by capturing high-order information on the user-news graph, whichare further combined with the content-based user representations. MVL [170] uses attention networks to learnuser interest representations in a content view, and uses a graph attention network to model user interest fromthe user-news graph in a graph view. GNUD [71] uses a disentangled graph convolution network to learn userrepresentations from the user-news graph. These methods can exploit the high-order information on graphsto enhance user modeling. GBAN [133] combines user embeddings learned by an LSTM and heterogeneousgraph embeddings. It further introduces subgraph core and coritivity scores that measure the importance of atarget user-news pair in the subgraph to enhance user representations. These methods can take the advantage ofhigh-order interaction information between user and news as well as the associated meta features. However, it ischallenging for them to accurately represent new users that do not participate in the model training.

We summarize the user information and user modeling techniques used in these deep learning-based methodsin Table 5. We then provide several discussions on the user modeling methods introduced in this section.

### 4.3 Discussions on User Modeling

#### 4.3.1 Feature-based User Modeling.

Most feature-based methods construct user proiles based on the collectionsof features extracted from the clicked news. Besides the news information, some methods leverage additionaluser features to facilitate user modeling. For example, the demographics of users (e.g., age, gender and profession)are used in several methods, since users with diferent demographics usually have diferent preferences onnews. The location of users can be used to identify the news related to the user’s neighborhood, and the accesspatterns of users can also help understand the news click behaviors of users. In addition, many methods usethe tags or keywords of users to indicate user interest, and cluster users based on their characteristics. In thisway, the recommender system can more efectively recommend news according to users’ interest in diferenttopics. Moreover, several methods incorporate user behaviors on other platforms, such as social media, searchengines and e-commerce platforms. These behaviors can not only facilitate user interest modeling, but also has the potential to mitigate the problem of cold-start on the news platform if user data can be successfullyaligned. However, feature-based user modeling methods usually require massive expertise for feature design andvalidation, and may not be optimal for representing user interests.

#### 4.3.2 Deep Learning-based User Modeling.

<img src="https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/a867894db8f9d544a471e86d8844008861f6a2ec/23-Table5-1.png">

Table 5. Comparison of different methods on user modeling.

Deep learning-based user modeling methods usually aim to learnuser representations from user behaviors without feature engineering. Many of them infer user interests merelyfrom click behaviors, because click behaviors are implicit indications of users interest in news. However, clickbehaviors are usually noisy and they do not necessarily indicate real user interests. Thus, many methods considerother kinds of information in user modeling. For example, some methods such as NPA and LSTUR incorporate theIDs of users to better capture users’ personal interest. CHAMELEON and DAINN consider the context features ofusers such as devices and user locations. CPRS, FeedRec and GBAN incorporate multiple kinds of user feedbackon the news platform to consider user engagement information in user interest modeling. GERL and GNewsReccan exploit the high-order information on graphs to encode user representations. However, it is still diicult forthese methods to accurately infer user interests when user behaviors on the news platforms are sparse. There areonly two methods, i.e., NRHUB and WG4Rec, that consider users’ behaviors on multiple platforms, which canstill model users accurately even user behaviors on the news platform are sparse. However, there may exist somediiculties in linking user data on diferent platforms due to privacy reasons.

According to the summarization in Table 3, we can see that the model architectures used for user representationlearning are diverse. Some methods utilize recurrent neural networks to capture the relatedness of news clickedby users, such as EBNR, DAN and CHAMELEON. With the great success of Transformer models, many methodsalso use self-attention or Transformer networks to model the global contexts of user behaviors. However, thesesequential models cannot efectively model the high-order relations between user behaviors, which can provideuseful contexts for user interest understanding. Instead of modeling user behaviors as a sequence, several methodslike User-as-Graph model each user as a personalized graph, where the high-order relations between behaviorscan be fully modeled. In addition, several works such as GERL and GNUD use graph neural networks to capturethe high-order interactions between users and news on the global user-news graphs, which can also help betterunderstand user interest by incorporating collaborative information. However, the computational cost of thesegraph-based architectures is usually much heavier than sequential models, and collaborative signals are usuallynot available for cold-start users and news.

To select clicked news that is informative for inferring user interest, attention mechanisms are widely used bymany methods. In some works such as NAML and KRED, the attention query is a global parameter vector, whichis invariant with respect to diferent users. In the NPA method, the attention query is generated by the embeddingof user ID, which can achieve personalized news selection. Both kinds of attention mechanisms are eicient inthe online test phase because user representations can be prepared in advance [204]. However, the relatednessbetween candidate news and clicked news cannot be fully modeled, which may not be optimal in modeling userinterests in a speciic candidate news. Another kind of attention mechanism, i.e., candidate-aware attention, isalso widely used by many methods such as DKN, DAN and KIM. In candidate-aware attention networks, therepresentation of candidate news is used as the attention query, and user representations can be dynamicallyconstructed based on candidate news. However, they need to memorize the representations of all clicked news inthe test phase, which may lead to some sacriice in eiciency.

Some methods study modeling multiple types of user interests. For example, LSTUR, GNewsRec and FedRecconsider both long-term and short-term interests of users to better capture their interest dynamics. HieRec modelsthe hierarchical structure of user interests, which can capture the user interests in diferent granularities. Thesemethods can improve user interest understanding of user interests by taking diferent kinds of user interest intoconsideration. However, user interests are diverse and evolutional, which are still diicult to be comprehensivelyand accurately modeled by these methods.

#### 4.3.3 Diferences to User Modeling in General Recommendation.

The user modeling techniques used for person-alized news recommendation have close relations to the user modeling methods in general recommendationscenarios such as e-commerce [246] and movie recommendation [35]. For example, the core neural architecturessuch as RNN, CNN, self-attention and graph neural networks, are also widely used for sequential recommendation.In addition, several useful user modeling paradigms such as long short-term user interest modeling are alsopopular in other recommendation ields. However, by scrutinizing recent literature, we ind there are severalunique characteristics of user modeling in personalized news recommendation:

(1) Short news lifecycles. Diferent from the common e-commerce recommendation scenarios where items canbe actively interacted with for months or even years [247], most news articles have very short lifecycles (i.e., a fewdays). Thus, in news recommendation it is important to take this unique characteristic into consideration whendesigning user modeling algorithms. For example, in GNN-based methods for general recommendation, itemnodes can be simply represented by ID embeddings. However, in GNN-based news recommender, it is better tolearn embeddings of news nodes from news content to handle uncovered news in user modeling [70]. In addition,the quick vanishment of old news de facto limits the exploitation of collaborative signals in user modeling due tothe large fraction of cold news in the inference stage.

(2) Fine-grained candidate-aware user modeling. In many recommendation tasks, items are mainly representedby their overall embeddings [183], and modeling feature interactions is important for candidate-aware usermodeling [246]. By contrast, news articles have rich content and context information, and the interactionsbetween user behaviors and candidate news can be modeled in a more ine-grained way (e.g., word-levelinteractions). Capturing the ine-grained relevance between user behaviors and candidate news is very importantfor understanding user interest in a speciic candidate news article. Thus, ine-grained candidate-aware usermodeling is a core technique used in many recent news recommendation methods.

(3) User modeling as document modeling. Diferent from many recommendation scenarios where user behaviorsare not associated with suicient textual information [245], in news recommendation user behaviors are usuallyclicked news that contain rich texts. Thus, the user modeling problem in news recommendation can be formulatedas a document modeling problem, where the texts of clicked news are embedded in user łdocuments”. Several recentmethods follow this setting and employ strong pre-trained language models to empower user modeling [81,241].The success of these PLM-based user modeling techniques indicates that there may not be a huge barrier betweenNLP and user modeling for news recommendation, which is a unique characteristic of the news recommendationield.

(4) Potential strong temporal diversity preference. Diferent from general recommendation scenarios whereusers may prefer to click very similar items, in news recommendation users tend to click news that are somewhatdiferent from the previously clicked ones [1] (i.e., preference on serendipity). As pointed by a recent study [216],it may not be very suitable to model news recommendation as a standard sequential recommendation task, andit is important to consider such temporal diversity preference in user modeling. The results show that manysequential models such as RNN [66] and casual self-attention [86] are inferior to standard self-attention thatfocus more on global context rather than sequential dependency. Further study on this unique phenomenon isneeded to better understand user modeling mechanism in news recommendation.

In summary, by reviewing user modeling techniques used in existing news recommendation methods, weargue that user modeling is also remained challenging due to many reasons, such as the noise and sparsity ofuser behaviors, the diverse and dynamic characteristics of user interests, and the diiculties in modeling userinterests in a speciic candidate news efectively and eiciently.

## 5 PERSONALIZED RANKING

On the basis of news and user modeling, news ranking aims to rank candidate news for personalized displayaccording to users’ personal interest. Common news ranking techniques can be divided into two categories, i.e.,relevance-based and reinforcement learning-based. We introduce them in the following sections.

### 5.1 Relevance-based Personalized Ranking

Relevance-based news ranking methods usually rank candidate news with user interests based on their personal-ized relevance. In these methods, how to accurately measure the relevance between candidate news and userinterest is a core problem. Many methods directly evaluate the user-news relevance based on the similarities oftheir inal representations. For instance, Goossen et al. [58] computed the cosine similarities between the CF-IDFfeature vectors of user and news to measure their relevance. Garcin et al. [52] used the similarities between thenews topic vectors and the user topic vector to evaluate their relevance. Okura et al. [144] used the inner productbetween news and user representations to predict the relevance scores. DFM [116] uses an inception module thatcombines neural networks with diferent depths to compute the relevance scores from news and user features.These methods usually employ two-tower architectures, which enable eicient inference by computing newsand user features in advance. However, user interests are usually diverse, and candidate news may only matchthe user interests indicated by a part of the clicked news. These methods cannot fully consider the relatednessbetween candidate news and clicked news, and the matching between candidate news and user interest may notbe very accurate.

A few methods use ine-grained interest matching techniques to better model the relevance between users’interest and candidate news. For example, FIM [196] irst multiplies together the word representations of candidatenews and clicked news, and then uses a matching module with 3-D CNN networks to compute relevance scoresby capturing the ine-grained relatedness between candidate news and clicked news. KIM [156] irst uses aknowledge-aware news co-encoder to model the relatedness between words and entities in candidate newsand clicked news, and further uses a user-news co-encoder to further help model the interactions betweenclicked news and candidate news for better relevance modeling. HieRec [160] has a hierarchical interest matchingmechanism that matches candidate news with the ine-grained subtopic-level user interest, the coarse-grainedtopic-level user interest and the overall user interest. AMM [240] uses a multi-ield matching scheme to model theinteractions between each pair of views of a clicked news and a candidate news. These single-tower methods canmore accurately evaluate the relevance between candidate news and user interest by modeling their ine-grainedand multi-grained relatedness, which can help generate news ranking results that better target user interest.However, these methods usually have much larger computational costs in the inference stage than coarse-grainedinterest matching, which may hinder their application in some low-latency or low-resource scenarios.

In most methods, candidate news with higher relevance to user interest will gain higher ranks. However, thesemethods may tend to recommend news that are similar to those previously clicked by users, which is also calledthe łilter bubble” problem. Thus, some news ranking methods explore to recommend news that are somewhatdiferent from previously clicked ones to introduce diversity and serendipity [1]. For example, Newsjunkie [47] isa system that ranks news articles based on their novelty in the context of the news that users previously clicked.SCENE [109] irst ranks news articles based on their relevance to user interests, and then reines the ranking listbased on news popularity and recency to form the inal recommendation list. Diferent from the methods that aresolely based on the relevance between candidate news and user interests, these methods have the potential toprovide more diverse recommendations.

### 5.2 Reinforcement Learning-based Personalized Ranking

Diferent from relevance-based ranking methods that mainly aim to optimize the objectives (e.g., clicks) oncurrent candidate news articles, reinforcement learning-based ranking methods usually aim to optimize thetotal reward in a long term [179,244]. A representative reinforcement learning-based approach to personalizednews recommendation is LinUCB [106], which models the problem of personalized news recommendation asa contextual bandit problem. In this method, LinUCB computes the payof by a hybrid linear model, whichmeans that some parameters are shared by all arms, while the others are not. LinUCB can outperform context-free bandit methods such asε-greedy and Upper Conidence Bound (UCB), and it is computationally eicientbecause the block parameters in LinUCB have ixed dimensions and can be incrementally updated [106]. It isalso latterly evaluated by [107] in an unbiased manner by estimating the per-trial payof with log data directlyrather than a simulator. In the CLEF NewsREEL 2017 challenge, Liang et al. [117] also developed a systembased on LinUCB. The LinUCB model is used to help choose the appropriate recommender from a pool ofrecommendation algorithms based on user and news features. Deep reinforcement learning is also explored innews recommendation [76,179,244]. For example, DRN [244] uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to estimate thepolicy reward, which is a weighted summation of click labels and the activeness of users that is computed basedon their return time after recommendations. In addition, DRN applies the Dueling Bandit Gradient Descent [233]algorithm to eliminate the recommendation performance decline brought by classical exploration methods suchasε-greedy and UCB. Diferent from relevance-based ranking methods, reinforcement learning-based rankingmethods have the ability of exploration, which can increase the diversity of recommendation results and furtherdiscover potential user interests.

### 5.3 Discussions on Personalized Ranking

In this section we provide some discussions on the news ranking methods in existing personalized news rec-ommender systems. Relevance-based news ranking methods mainly need to accurately evaluate the relevancebetween candidate news and user interest for subsequent news ranking. Many methods model their overallrelevance by evaluating the relevance between the uniied representations of user interest and candidate news.However, candidate news usually can only match part of user interests, and directly match the overall user interestwith candidate news may be suboptimal. A few methods explore to evaluate the relevance between user interestand candidate news in a ine-grained way by modeling the relatedness between candidate news and clicked news,which can improve the accuracy of relevance modeling for news ranking. However, these methods are muchmore time-consuming because the representations of users are dependent on candidate news and cannot becomputed in advance. Moreover, pure relevance-based interest matching methods may tend to recommend newsthat are similar to previously clicked news, which is not beneicial for users to receive diverse news information.Thus, a few works explore to adjust the news ranking strategy by incorporating other factors such as newsnovelty, popularity and recency, which have the potential to make more diverse news recommendations andmitigate the filter bubble problem in news recommender systems.

In relevance-based news ranking methods, candidate news is usually greedily matched with users, i.e., choosingthe news in each impression that mostly satisfy the ranking policy on the current candidate news list. However,it may not be optimal in improving long-term user experience. In reinforcement learning-based methods, theranking algorithm aims to ind the optimal ranking policy to maximize the long-term reward. Thus, RL-basednews ranking methods may be more suitable for exploring potential user interest and improving long-term userexperience and engagement, while it may have some sacriice in short-term news CTRs.

In summary, news ranking in news recommendation also faces many challenges, including how to accuratelyand eiciently evaluate the relevance between candidate news and user interest indicated by user behaviors, how to mitigate the łilter bubble” problem in news recommender systems, and how to explore potential user interestswithout hurting user experience.

## 6 MODEL TRAINING

Many personalized news recommendation methods exploit machine learning models for news modeling, user mod-eling and interest matching. Training these models is a necessary step in building an accurate news recommendersystem. In this section, we review the techniques used for model training in news recommendation.

### 6.1 Training Methods

In a few methods based on collaborative iltering, the news recommendation task is formulated as a ratingprediction problem, i.e., predicting the ratings that users give to news [78]. To learn their models, they usuallyuse loss functions such as the mean squared error (MSE) computed between the predicted ratings and the goldratings, which are further used to optimize the model [26]. However, explicit user feedback like rating is usuallyvery sparse, which may be insuicient to train an accurate recommendation model.

Since implicit feedback such as click is abundant, most methods use the click feedback of users as the predictiontarget. They formulate the news recommendation task as a click prediction task. Some methods simply classifywhether a candidate news will be clicked by a target user [43,55,197]. However, these methods cannot exploitthe relatedness between clicked and nonclicked samples. Thus, a few methods use contrastive training techniquesto maximize the margin between the predicted click scores of clicked and nonclicked news. For example, PP-Rec [157] uses the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss for model training by comparing each clickedsample with an nonclicked one. However, the BPR loss can only exploit a small part of nonclicked samples.NPA [204] uses the InfoNCE [145] loss for model training. For each clicked sample (regarded as a positive sample),it randomly samples a certain number of nonclicked ones (regarded as negative samples) and jointly predictstheir click scores. These click scores are further normalized by the softmax function to compute the posteriorclick probabilities, and the model aims to maximize the negative log-likelihood of the posterior click probabilityof positive samples. In this way, the model can exploit the information of more negative samples.

Besides click feedback, a few methods also consider other kinds of feedback to construct training tasks.For example, CPRS [213] trains the recommendation model collaboratively in the click prediction task and anadditional reading satisfaction prediction task, which aims to infer the personalized reading speed based on userinterest and news body. FeedRec [215] trains the model in three tasks, including click prediction, dwell timeprediction and inish prediction. GBAN [133] models the recommendation task as a future behavior classiicationproblem to predict the behavior type of a user on a speciic candidate (i.e., click, nonclick, like, follow, comment,and share).2These methods can encourage the model to optimize not only CTR but also user engagement, whichcan help learn engagement-aware news recommendation models.

There are several methods that use additional news information to design auxiliary training tasks. For exam-ple, EBNR [144] uses autoencoder to learn news representations and it uses another weak supervision task byencouraging the embeddings of news in the same topic to be similar than the embeddings of news in diferenttopics. TANR [205] uses an auxiliary news topic prediction task to help learn topic-aware news representa-tions. SentiRec [212] uses a news sentiment orientation score prediction task to learn sentiment-bearing newsrepresentations. KRED [121] trains the model in various tasks including item recommendation, item-to-itemrecommendation, category classiication, popularity prediction and local news detection. These methods canalso efectively encode additional information into the recommendation model without taking it as the input.However, it is usually non-trivial to balance the main recommendation task and the auxiliary tasks.

### 6.2 Training Environment

Existing researches mainly focus on the model training methods while ignoring the implementation environmentof model training, which is in fact important in developing real-world news recommender systems. In manyexisting methods, the news recommendation models are oline trained on centrally stored data with centralizedcomputing resources [223]. This model training paradigm can help quick development of news recommendersystems, but it also has several main drawbacks. First, user behavior data for model training is usually abundantand many recent news recommendation models are in large size [214], which require a large amount of computingresource to train accurate models. Although some recent works like [214] explore to train models in parallelon multiple GPUs, it is still insuicient to train huge models. Thus, distributed model learning with properacceleration methods like data rearrangement and cache mechanisms may be required in industrial practice [224].Second, the model learned on oline data only may also have some mismatches with the characteristics ofrecommendation scenarios [244]. Moreover, the distribution of user interest and news topics may also evolve, andit is shown in previous research that the performance of oline trained models may decline with time [204]. Thus,instead of re-training models periodically, online model training on streaming data is needed. Third, most existingnews recommendation methods are trained on centrally stored user data, which may have some privacy risksbecause user data usually contains private user information. Several recent works like [158,159,231] explore totrain news recommendation models based on decentralized data with federated learning techniques, which canbetter protect user privacy in model training.

### 6.3 Discussions on Model Training

Next, we provide some discussions on the model training techniques used in news recommendation methods.In some CF-based methods, news recommendation is modeled as a regression task where the ratings given byusers are regarded as prediction targets. However, on news platforms explicit user feedback such as rating isusually scarce, which poses great challenges to model training. Therefore, most methods adopt implicit feedbackto construct training tasks. Click feedback is one of the most widely used signals for model training because itcan implicitly indicate user interests in news and help the model optimize the CTR of recommendation results.However, click signals also have some gaps with the real user interests [232], and increasing CTR only may leadto recommending clickbait news to users, which is actually harmful to user experience. Thus, a few methodsincorporating other user engagement signals such as dwell time and inish into model training, which can helplearn user engagement-aware recommendation model to improve user experience. Besides user feedback, somemethods also consider using additional news information as auxiliary prediction objectives. By jointly trainingthe model in both recommendation task and auxiliary tasks, the model can be aware of the additional newsinformation. Since these methods do not take the additional features as the input, they can handle the scenarioswhere the additional features are unavailable. However, in multi-task learning based methods, it is diicult tochoose the proper coeicients for weighting the loss functions of diferent tasks, and these coeicients may alsobe sensitive to the dataset characteristics.

Another important problem in model training is designing efective strategies for constructing labeled trainingsamples. In most methods the negative samples are randomly drawn from the entire news set or the impressionlist [218], which are further packed with the positive samples. However, researchers have found that randomlyselected negative samples may be too easy for the model to distinguish, which is not beneicial for learningdiscriminative recommendation models [105]. It is also an interesting problem to study the inluence of thenumber of negative samples on model training [208].

Besides, the environment for news recommendation model training is a less studied but important problem.Most researches are oline conducted by learning models on centralized data with centralized computing resources.As discussed in the previous section, this model training environment may pose many potential challenges like the limitation of centralized computing resources, the gaps between oline data and online applications, and theprivacy concerns and risks of centralized model training, which need to be extensively studied in the future.

In summary, model training is critical for news recommendation while it still has much room for improvement,such as designing more efective training tasks, choosing more representative training samples, adaptivelytuning the loss coeicients for multi-task learning, and building more efective, eicient and privacy-preservingenvironment for news recommendation model training.

#### 6.3.1 A Bird’s-eye View on Recent Approaches.

To help readers better understand the details of recent newsrecommendation methods in terms of their news modeling, user modeling, ranking, and model training techniques,we illustrate a joint table that summarizes their details in these aspects. Due to the limitation of page sizes, we do notinclude it in the main content, and readers can refer to it in a public repository (https://github.com/wuch15/News-Rec-Survey).

## 7 EVALUATION METRICS

There are many metrics to quantitatively evaluate the performance of news recommender systems. Most metricsaim to measure the recommendation performance in terms of the ranking relevance. For methods that regard thetask of news recommendation as a classiication problem, the Area Under Curve (AUC) score is a widely usedmetric, which is formulated as follows:

formula (1)

where $N_p$ and $N_n$ the numbers of positive and negative samples, respectively. $p_i$ is the predicted score of the i-th positive sample and $n_j$ is the score of the j-th negative sample. Another set of popular metrics are precision,recall and F1 scores, which are computed as:

formula (2), (3), (4)

where TP, FP and FN respectively denote true positive, false positive and false negative.

For methods that model news recommendation as a regression task (e.g., predict the ratings of news), severalcommon metrics for regression such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), rooted meansquared error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coeicient (PCC) are used to indicate the recommendationperformance, which are respectively formulated as follows:

formula (5), (6), (7), (8)

where $r_i$ and $p_i$ are the real and predicted ratings of the i-th sample, ̄r and ̄p respectively denote the arithmeticmean of the real and predicted ratings, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

For methods that regard news recommendation as a ranking task, besides the AUC metric there are also severalother metrics such as Average Precision (AP), Hit Ratio (HR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and normalizedDiscounted Cummulative Gain (nDCG). Note that these metrics may be applied to the top K recommendationlists, e.g., HR@K and nDCG@K. These metrics are respectively formulated as follows:

formula 9,10, 11, 12

where $r_i$ is a relevance score of news with the i-th rank, which is 1 for clicked news and 0 for non-clicked news.There are several other metrics such as Click-Through Rate (CTR) and dwell time, which can be only used tomeasure the performance of online news recommenders.

Besides the metrics for measuring ranking accuracy, there are several other objective or subjective metricsto evaluate news recommender systems in other aspects. In [47] the recommendation results are evaluated bynovelty, which is subjectively judged by a group of human subjects by rating the news sets from most novel to leastnovel. In FeedRec [215], the recommendation results are further evaluated by a set of user engagement-relatedmetrics, such as the average dwell time, inish ratio, dislike ratio and share ratio of the top ranked news. Thesemetrics can help comprehensively evaluate the performance of news recommender systems and further improveuser experience. A few methods also measure the diversity of recommendation results in diferent aspects. Forexample, in [244], an Intra-List Similarity (ILS) function is used to measure the diversity of recommendationresults. More speciically, given a ranking list $L$, its ILS score is calculated as follows:

formula 13

where $S(b_i,b_j)$ represents the cosine similarity between the item $b_i$ and $b_j$. A similar diversity metric ILAD is alsoused in [157,160]. SentiRec [212] uses a set of sentiment diversity metrics to measure the sentiment diferencebetween historical clicked news and candidate news, which are formulated as follows:

formula 14

where N is the number of candidate news in an impression,$s_i^c$ denotes the sentiment score of the i-th ranked candidate news.

Besides diversity, several fairness metrics are used to measure whether a news recommender system is fair todiferent groups of users or diferent news publishers. For example, FairRec [221] uses the accuracy of sensitiveattribute (e.g., gender) prediction based on top recommendation results as the fairness metric, where a higheraccuracy means more serious unfairness because the recommendation results are more heavily inluenced bysensitive attributes. [57] studies the news recommendation fairness to diferent groups of authors. It uses anEquity Attention for group fairness (EAGF) measurement and a Supplier Popularity Deviation (SPD) measurementfor evaluating such kind of fairness, which if formulated as follows:

formula 15

where g is the set of author groups and $L(i)$ is the set of recommended news belonging to the i-th group,Lis theset of all recommended items, $A(i)$ is the set of items in the training set belonging to thei-th group, andAis thewhole set of items. A higher EAGF and a lower SPD score indicate better fairness. These metrics used in the twoworks can be used to measure user-side fairness and provider-side fairness, respectively.

With the development of privacy-preserving news recommendation methods based on federated learning,a few measurements can be used to evaluate the degree of privacy protection in news recommendation. Forexample, in FedRec [158] the privacy protection ability of the model can be directly indicated by the privacybudget of model gradients. In addition, privacy protection can also be measured by conducting membershipinference attack on user behavior histories to guess whether a behavior belongs to a target user [159]. Thesemetrics can indicate whether private user information encoded in exchanged models results is well-protected.

## 8 DATASET, COMPETITION AND BENCHMARK

Table 6. Comparisons of the five public datasets for news recommendation.

<img src="https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/a867894db8f9d544a471e86d8844008861f6a2ec/33-Table6-1.png">

Many works in the news recommendation ield are based on proprietary datasets, such as those collected fromGoogle News [29], Yahoo’s news [144], Bing news [116] and MSN news [204]. There are only a few publiclyavailable datasets for the research on personalized news recommendation, which are respectively introduced asfollows.

The irst one is the plista [91] dataset. It is constructed by collecting the 70,353 news articles from 13 Germannews portals as well as 1,095,323 news click logs of users. In the CLEF 2017 NewsREEL task, the organizers publisha new version of the plista dataset, which records users’ interactions with news from eight publishers in February2016. This dataset contains 2 million notiications, 58 thousand news updates, and 168 million recommendationrequests. The language used in the plista datasets is German since it is mainly based on the news websites andusers in German speaking world. Note that the number of users is not provided.

The second one is the Adressa [61] dataset, which was constructed by collecting the news logs of the Adresseav-isen website in three months. It has a full version with logs in 10 weeks and a small version with logs in oneweek. The small version contains 561,733 users, 11,207 articles and 2,286,835 clicks, and the full version contains3,083,438 users, 48,486 articles and 27,223,576 clicks. The news articles in Adressa are written in Norwegian.

The third one is the Globo [31] dataset, which is retrieved from the Globo news portal in Brazil. This datasetcontains about 314,000 users, 46,000 news articles and 3 million news clicks. This dataset is in Portuguese, andthere is no original news text in this dataset, and it only provides the embeddings of words generated by a neuralmodel that is pre-trained in a news metadata classiication task.

The fourth one is a Yahoo!3dataset for session-based news recommendation. It contains 14,180 news articlesand 34,022 click events. In this dataset, no news text is provided and the number of users is also unknown becausethere is no information about user ID.

The ifth one is the MIND [223]4dataset, which is a large-scale English dataset for news recommendation.This dataset is recently released by MSN News, which contains the real news logs of 1 million users in 6 weeks(from October 12 to November 22, 2019). It involves 161,013 news articles, 15,777,377 impressions and 24,155,470news clicks.

We present a comparison of the volume, textual information and leaderboard information of these datasets inTable 6. We can see that only the MIND dataset is associated with a public leaderboard. In fact, many researchesconducted on other datasets such as Adressa use diferent dataset preprocessing methods [70,248], making itdiicult to make head-to-head comparisons between the results reported in diferent papers. On the contrary, onthe MIND dataset the training, validation and test samples are given, and the evaluation metrics are consistent.Thus, MIND can serve as a standard testbed for news recommendation research.

Based on the datasets introduced above, several competitions and benchmarks on personalized news recom-mendation have been established. One representative one is the NEWSREEL challenge held from 2013 to 2017 (in2013 the challenge is named NRS).5There are usually two tasks in the NEWSREEL challenge. The irst one isnews recommendation in a living lab, which are conducted on an operating news recommendation service. Thegoal of recommendation algorithms in this task is achieving high news CTRs. The second one is oline evaluationof news recommendation methods in a simulated environment. This task is performed based on the plista dataset,and the goal is to predict which news articles a visitor would read in the future. In the 2017 edition of NewsREEL87 participants are registered [92], and two systems achieved CTRs higher than 2% in the online evaluation task.

Another recent competition is the MIND News Recommendation Competition6, which is conducted on theMIND dataset. The goal of this challenge is to predict the click scores of candidate news based on user interestsand rank candidate news in each impression. This challenge attracted more than 200 registered participantsand the top submission achieved 71.33% in terms of AUC. The leaderboard of this challenge opens after thechallenge, and researchers can submit their predictions on the test set to obtain the oicial evaluation scores. Thecurrent top result on this leaderboard is 73.04% in terms of AUC, which is achieved by a recommender namedłUniUM-Fastformer-Pretrain” based on the techniques in [214] and [219]. The MIND dataset, challenge and thepublic leaderboard can form a good benchmark to facilitate research and engineering on personalized newsrecommendation.

## 9 RESPONSIBLE PERSONALIZED NEWS RECOMMENDATION

Although personalized news recommendation techniques have achieved notable success in targeting user interest,they still have several issues that may afect user experience and even lead to potential negative social impacts.There are several critical problems in developing more responsible personalized news recommender systems,including privacy protection, debiasing and fairness, diversity, and content quality, which are discussed in thefollowing sections, respectively.

### 9.1 Privacy Protection

Most existing personalized news recommender systems rely on centralized storage of users’ behavior data foruser modeling and model training. However, user behaviors are usually privacy sensitive, and centrally storing them may lead to users’ privacy concerns and further risks on data leakage [115]. There are only a few works thatstudy the privacy preservation problem in news recommendation [32,158]. For example, FedRec [158] may bethe irst attempt to learning privacy-preserving news recommendation model. Instead of collecting and storinguser behavior data in a central server, in FedRec users’ news click data are locally stored on user devices. FedRecuses a federated learning based framework to collaboratively learn news recommendation model. Each clientkeeps a local copy of the model and locally computes the model updates based on local data. The local modelupdates are uploaded to a central server that coordinates a number of user clients for model training. The serveraggregates the local gradients into a global one to update its maintained global model, and distributes the updatedglobal model to user devices for local update. In addition, to further protect user privacy, FedRec applies localdiferential privacy (LDP) techniques to perturb the local model gradients. Since the protected model gradientsusually contain much less private information, user privacy can be better protected. However, FedRec is only aframework for privacy-preserving news recommendation model training, and privacy-preserving online servingis still a challenging problem.

Uni-FedRec [159] is an improved version of FedRec that considers both privacy-preserving training and serving.It has a recall stage to generate dozens of candidates from the news pool in the server and a ranking stage tolocally rank candidate news. In the recall stage, Uni-FedRec generates multiple user embeddings to better coveruser interest. Instead of sending the original user embedding learned by the user model, it decomposes eachuser embedding into a linear combination of several basis user embeddings, and the combination weights areprotected by LDP before sending to the server. The server reconstructs user embeddings to retrieve candidatenews and send them to clients for local ranking. This framework can be used for both model training andserving in a privacy preserving way. However, there are still considerable communication costs in this framework.Eicient-FedRec [231] further studies how to reduce the communication costs of federated news recommendationmodel learning. It decomposes the whole model into a heavy news model and a light-weight user model, wherethe news model is placed on the server while the user model is kept by clients. The hidden news representationsinferred by the news model on the server are distributed to clients in the model training. This method providesthe potential of incorporating big models such as BERT in federated news recommendation.

Although existing works on privacy-preserving news recommendation have made notable progresses, there arestill many challenges in this ield, such as the huge performance sacriice of diferential privacy mechanism, thediiculty of involving some context features (e.g., CTR) and collaborative information in GNN, and the diicultyof real-world deployment of federated news recommender systems.

### 9.2 Debiasing

User behavior data usually encodes various kinds of biases. Some kinds of biases are related to news. For example,click behaviors are inluenced by the positions and sizes of news displayed on the webpages (i.e., presentationbias) [230]. In addition, popular news may have higher chances to be clicked than unpopular news (i.e., popularitybias) [157]. These types of bias information may afect the accuracy of user interest modeling and model training.A few works explore to eliminate the inluence of certain kinds of bias information to improve personalized newsrecommendation. For instance, DebiasRec [230] aims to reduce the inluence of position and size biases on newsrecommendation. It uses a bias-aware user modeling method to learn debiased user interest representations,and uses a bias-aware click prediction method that decomposes the overall click score into a bias score and abias-independent user preference score. PP-Rec [157] uses a popularity-aware user modeling method to learncalibrated user interest representations, and it separately models the popularity of news and users’ personalpreference on news, which can help better model personalized user interest. These methods mainly aim toinfer debiased user interest from biased user data. However, without any prior knowledge about unbiased datadistribution, the bias information usually cannot be fully eliminated. In addition, many kinds of bias such as exposure and selection biases are rarely studied in the news recommendation ield. Thus, it is important forfuture research to understand how diferent biases afect user behaviors and the recommendation model as wellas how to eliminate their efect in model training and evaluation.

### 9.3 Fairness

Making fair recommendations is an important problem in responsible news recommendation. Researchers havestudied various kinds of fairness problems in recommendation, such as provider-side fairness and consumer-sidefairness [12]. In personalized news recommendation, a representative kind of unfairness is brought by the biasesrelated to sensitive user attributes, such as genders and professions. Users with the same sensitive attributesmay have similar patterns in news click behaviors, e.g., fashion news are more preferred by female users. Themodel may capture these biases and produce biased recommendation results, e.g., tend to only recommendfashion news to female users. This will lead to the unfairness problem that some users cannot obtain theirinterested news information, which is harmful to user experience. To address this problem, FairRec [221] uses adecomposed adversarial learning framework with independent user models to learn a bias-aware user embeddingand a bias-free user embedding. The bias-aware user embedding mainly aims to capture bias information relatedto sensitive user attributes, and the bias-free user embedding aims to model bias-independent user interest.Both embeddings are regularized to be orthogonal thereby the bias-free user embedding can contain less biasinformation. The bias-free user embedding is further used for making fair news recommendations. By learninguser embeddings that are agnostic to the sensitive user attributes, the unfairness brought by the bias informationrelated to sensitive user attributes can be efectively mitigated. However, adversarial learning based methods areusually brittle and it is diicult to tune their hyperparameters to fully remove the bias information. In addition,many other genres of fairness (e.g., provider-side fairness) are less studied in news recommendation. In summary,there are many types of fairness to be improved in news recommendation and it is non-trivial to make both fairand accurate news recommendations.

### 9.4 Diversity

Diversity is critical for personalized news recommendation [124,155,169]. Users may not prefer to click news withhomogeneous information and improving the information variety is important for improving user experience andengagement [6]. However, most existing news recommendation methods focus on optimizing recommendationaccuracy while ignoring recommendation diversity, and it is shown in [157,160,212] that many existing newsrecommendation methods cannot make suiciently diverse recommendations. There are only a few methods thatconsider the diversity of news recommendation. Some methods aim to recommend news that are diverse frompreviously clicked news [47,212], and several other works explore to diversify the top news recommendationlist [46,109]. However, there is still no work on promoting both kinds of diversity in news recommendation.In addition, many diversity-aware news recommendation methods rely on reranking strategies to improverecommendation diversity, which may not be optimal for achieving a good tradeof between recommendationaccuracy and diversity. Thus, further research on learning uniied diversity-aware news recommendation modelsis important for improving the quality of online news services.

### 9.5 Content Moderation

The moderation of news content in news recommendation is a rarely studied problem. In fact, some newsarticles published online are clickbaits, fake news or containing misinformation. In addition, some news mayencode adversarial clues [33] or contain low-quality or even harmful content (e.g., racialism and hate speech).Recommending these news will damage user experience and the reputation of news platforms, and may evenlead to negative societal impact [101]. Although online news platforms can perform manual moderation on news content quality, the huge amount of online news information makes it too diicult or even impossible to ilter allnews articles with harmful and useless content. Thus, it is important to design news recommendation algorithmsthat can avoid recommending news with low-quality content. Researchers have found that news with high ratiosof short reading dwell time (e.g., less than 10 seconds) are probably clickbaits [209]. In addition, user behaviorssuch as comments and sharing on social media may also provide rich clues for detecting news that containmisinformation and harmful content [4,177]. Thus, incorporating the various user feedback has the potential tohelp recommend news with high-quality content, which can improve the responsibility of news recommendationalgorithms.

## 10 FUTURE DIRECTION AND CONCLUSION

### 10.1 Deep News Understanding

News modeling is at the heart of personalized news recommendation. It can be improved in the following aspects.First, text understanding is a core problem in news modeling, and existing methods may not be capable ofunderstanding the textual content of news deeply. Thus, using more advanced NLP techniques (e.g., knowledge-aware PLMs) may help better understand news texts and improve news modeling. Second, besides textualinformation, news also contain rich multimodal information such as images, videos and slides. The multimodalnews content can provide complementary information on news understanding. Thus, using multimodal contentmodeling techniques has the potential to improve the comprehensiveness of news understanding. Third, thereare many useful factors for news modeling that are not covered by news content, such as publisher, popularityand recency. A uniied framework is required to incorporate various kinds of news information (e.g., propertyfeatures and context features) and meanwhile efectively model the relatedness between diferent features. Furtherresearch on these directions can help understand news more accurately and deeply to empower subsequent usermodeling and news ranking.

### 10.2 Universal User Modeling

User modeling is critical for understanding users’ interest in news. However, it is diicult to model the dynamic anddiverse user interest accurately and comprehensively for news recommendation. To tackle this problem, a universaluser modeling framework that can model various kinds of user interest is needed. We argue that this frameworkshould satisfy the following requirements. First, the user modeling framework needs to comprehensively inferuser interest from multiple kinds of user behaviors and feedback. This is because click behaviors are very noisyand may be sparse for some users, and it is insuicient to model user interests solely from click behaviors.Fortunately, diferent kinds of user behaviors and feedback (e.g., read and dislike) can provide rich complementaryinformation like user engagement, and incorporating them in a uniied framework can better support usermodeling. Second, the framework needs to model the diverse and multi-grained user interest. Since a single userembedding may be insuicient to comprehensively model user interests, it may be a promising way to representuser interest with more sophisticated structures such as embedding sets and graphs to improve the understandingof user interest. Third, the framework needs to capture the dynamics of user interests. Since user interest usuallyevolves with time, it is important to understand user interest in diferent periods and further model their inherentrelations. To meet this end, using more advanced sequence modeling techniques may help improve user interestmodeling in personalized news recommendation.

### 10.3 Efective and Eficient Personalized Ranking

News ranking is an essential step to make personalized news recommendations. There are mainly three researchdirections to improve news ranking. First, most existing personalized ranking methods are mainly based thecoarse-grained relevance between candidate news and user interest, which may not be optimal for accuratelytargeting user interest. Although a few methods can model the ine-grained relatedness between user and news,they are ineicient and may not be suitable for scenarios with limited computation resources and latency tolerance.Thus, developing both efective and eicient personalized ranking methods is important for improving onlinenews recommendation. Second, ranking news solely based on relevance may lead to the ilter bubble problem. It isimportant to design more sophisticated news ranking strategies to achieve a good tradeof between accuracy anddiversity. Third, most existing news ranking methods are greedy, i.e., only consider the current ranking list in theranking policy. However, they may not be optimal for achieving good user engagement in the long-term. Thus,designing proper news ranking strategies to optimize long-term rewards may be beneicial for user experience.

### 10.4 Hyperbolic Representation Learning for News Recommendation

In most existing news recommendation methods, news and users representations are learned in Euclidean space.Matching functions such as inner product and cosine similarity are widely used for computing relevance scoresfor news ranking. However, representation learning in Euclidean space is inefective in capturing the hierarchicalstructure of data, while hyperbolic representation learning is much better at it. There are many inherent hierarchi-cal data structures in personalized news recommendation, such as diferent levels of user interests, news topics,and commonsense knowledge encoded by knowledge graphs. Thus, news recommendation with hyperbolicrepresentation learning may be a promising solution. There are several existing neural architectures in hyperbolicspace, such as hyperbolic attention [60] and hyperbolic GCN [20], which can serve as the core model componentsin news recommendation. In addition, there have been several successful applications of hyperbolic representationlearning to CF-based recommendation [184,194] and knowledge graph embedding [19,198], which can provideuseful guidance of collaborative signal modeling and knowledge exploitation in news recommendation. Futureresearch on hyperbolic representation learning may create a new direction to overcome several drawbacks ofcurrent user/news modeling and personalized ranking techniques conducted in Euclidean space.

### 10.5 Unified Model Training

Model training techniques are also important for learning efective and robust personalized news recommendationmodels. There are four potential directions for future works to improve model training. First, most methods onlyuse click signals for model training, which may be inaccurate because click signals are usually noisy and biased.In addition, the supervision signals in speciic tasks may also be insuicient [220]. Thus, a uniied frameworkto incorporate various kinds of supervised and self-supervised training signals and objectives for collaborativemodel learning can efectively improve the model quality. Second, although several methods explore to usemulti-task learning frameworks to incorporate multiple objectives into model training, they need to manuallytune the loss coeicients of diferent tasks in model training, which usually require much human efort and maybe sensitive to the characteristics of datasets. Thus, a self-adaptive multi-task learning framework to automaticallytune hyperparameters like loss coeicients can reduce the developing efort and improve the model generality.Third, many methods use randomly selected negative samples for model training, which may be noisy andless informative. Thus, using more efective negative sampling can help train more robust and accurate newsrecommendation models. Fourth, oline trained models may have gaps with the online scenarios and may suferfrom the performance decline with time. Thus, it is important to incorporate both oline and online learningtechniques to help the model better adapt to the latest online serving requirements.

### 10.6 News Recommendation in Social Context

On some news platforms, users may have social interactions with other users in many ways, such as leavingcomments, replies, and sharing to their social media blogs like Twitter. The social interactions among usersconcerning certain news can usually relect their opinions, preferences, and satisfaction on the recommendednews [200], which can provide rich complementary information to user modeling. In addition, users’ discussionsand dissemination behaviors can also help understand the content, quality and authenticity of news [177]. Besides,they can help recognize breaking news and adjust recommendation results accordingly [153]. Therefore, thesocial contexts of news recommendation play an important role. However, they are usually neglected by newsrecommendation researches in recent years. In future researches, it is an interesting topic to study the impacts ofusers’ online social interactions on the accuracy, timeliness and quality of news personalization.

### 10.7 Privacy-preserving News Recommendation

In recent years, the ethical issues of intelligent systems have attracted much attention from both the academiaand public. Developing more responsible news recommender systems can help better serve users of onlinenews services with smaller risks. One important direction for improving the responsibility of personalized newsrecommendation is user privacy protection. Although a few works like [158] explore to use federated learningtechniques to train news recommendation models in a privacy-preserving way, there are still many challenges indeveloping a privacy-preserving news recommender system. First, given a model learned in a federated way, it isstill challenging to deploy it online to serve users eiciently. Second, there may also be potential privacy risksduring the training and serving of news recommendation models, and canonical diferential privacy techniquesusually lead to a heavy sacriice on model utility. Third, the data isolation problem in federated learning frameworksettings makes it diicult to exploit some context features like CTR and collaborative information in GNN. Thus,further researches on developing more efective, eicient and privacy-preserving news recommendation methodsare needed.

### 10.8 Secure and Robust News Recommendation

Existing researches on news recommendation focus on building algorithms in a trusted environment. However,in real-world scenarios there may be various kinds of threats brought by malicious users and platforms. Forexample, existing news recommendation methods are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, which aim to promotecertain items, trigger certain backdoors, or degrade the recommender system performance. In addition, newsrecommender systems may be sensitive to adversarial samples. When news recommender systems are trainedin the federated learning framework, the threats from the untrusted outside environment become even moreserious. Unfortunately, although the security and robustness of personalized news recommender systems arecritical, researches on this problem are rather limited. Future studies on secure and robust news recommendationare important for the stability and reliability of online news platforms.

### 10.9 Diversity-aware News Recommendation

Besides accuracy, diversity in news recommendation also has decisive inluence on user experience. There arethree main research directions to improve the diversity of news recommendation. The irst one is temporal-spatialdiversity-aware news recommendation, which aims to recommend news that are diverse from each other andmeanwhile diverse from historical clicked news. This can help the recommendation results better satisfy users’preference on information variety. The second one is personalizing the diversity in news recommendation.Diferent users may have diferent preferences on the tradeof between accuracy and diversity, and it maybe better to consider their personalized preference to improve user experience. The third one is ine-graineddiversity, which aims to not only diversify the content and topic of news, but also many other factors like publishers, locations, opinions and emotions. It has the potential to make higher-quality diversity-aware newsrecommendations.

### 10.10 Bias-free News Recommendation

Debiasing is another important problem in improving the responsibility of news recommendation. The biasesencoded by user behavior data will propagate to the recommendation model and may further be ampliied inthe loops of recommendation. Thus, designing efective methods to eliminate the inluence of the various kindsof biases on recommendation results is important for making high-quality news recommendations. There areseveral potential research directions in this ield. First, it is important to understand the inluence of diferentkinds of biases on user behaviors and the recommendation model, which can help the subsequent debiasing.Second, diferent users may be inluenced by the same bias information in diferent ways, and considering thepersonalized preference of users on bias information can help better eliminate the efects of biases. Third, thereare various kinds of biases in news recommendation. A uniied debiasing framework that can simultaneouslyreduce the efects of diferent biases can greatly improve the accuracy and robustness of news recommendationalgorithms.

### 10.11 Fairness-aware News Recommendation

Fairness is an essential but often ignored factor in personalized news recommendation. A fair news recommendersystem is required to provide fair recommendation services to diferent groups of users and give fair chancesto news from diferent providers to be recommended. Future research on fair news recommendation can beconducted in the following three directions. First, it is important to reduce the consumer-side unfairness relatedto sensitive user attributes. Although adversarial learning techniques are mature solutions to this problem, theyare usually brittle and diicult to tune. Thus, more robust and efective methods are required to remove thebiases introduced by sensitive user attributes. Second, diferent news providers and publishers are diverse intheir characteristics, such as topic preference and reputation. Thus, it is non-trivial to properly balance therecommendation chances of news from diferent providers and publishers to achieve better provider-side fairness.Third, there are diferent types of fairness in the personalized news recommendation scenario, and it is verychallenging to simultaneously achieve multi-side fairness without a heavy sacriice of recommendation accuracy.

### 10.12 Content Moderation in News Recommendation

The moderation of news content is important for online news platforms to avoid recommending news withlow quality or harmful content to users and mitigate their impact on users and society. However, this issue israrely studied and cannot be resolved by most existing news recommendation methods. There are three keyresearch directions on this problem. First, it is essential to understand the generation and spreading mechanism ofharmful news as well as their impact on users, which can help news platforms better defend toxic content. Second,it may be useful to incorporate content moderation techniques like fake news detection [177] and clickbaitdetection [211] into news recommendation to adjust the recommendation results according to the quality ofnews content. Third, without the assistance of additional tasks and resources, we can learn content quality-awarenews recommendation models with the guidance of certain kinds of user feedback such as comments and dislikes,which is expected to help recommend high-quality news to users.

### 10.13 Societal Impact of News Recommendation

News recommender systems can generate societal impact when they serve a certain number of users. They mayimperceptibly inluence the opinions and views of users when displaying personalized news content [134]. Thus, itis valuable for further research to identify and analyze the societal impact of personalized news recommendation algorithms, such as their inluence on political events, economic activities and psychological health. In addition,research on how to reduce the potential negative societal impact of personalized news recommendation methodscan help avoid their risky behaviors and better serve online users.
