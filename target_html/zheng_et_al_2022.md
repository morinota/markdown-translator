Evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies for a subtropical city centre (a case study in Osaka, Japan)

## 0.2. abstruct

Urban heat island (UHI) effects were first observed in London in the 19th century. The urban heat island is identified by developing higher temperatures in urban areas than the surrounding rural areas that directly surround them. However, there are some main mitigation strategies to deal with subtropical UHI, such as increasing the albedo of the urban environment (reflective pavement) and developing the green infrastructure (green roof) in urban areas. This study would analyse the microclimate in a subtropical city by evaluating meteorological parameters with a three-dimensional model simulation software of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) named ENVI-Met.

To evaluate Urban Heat Island mitigation strategies for a Subtropical City Centre, subtropical city Osaka, Japan, is selected to investigate UHI with modelling. The simulation has been used to applicate the five scenarios (base scenario, cool pavement scenario, cool roof scenario, increasing vegetation coverage scenario, and integrated scenario) with different albedo and vegetation coverage ratios. In this study, outdoor air temperature, sky view factor, net radiation, mean radiant temperature and thermal radiative power are considered as five criteria for evaluating the efficiency of UHI mitigation strategies. The simulation results of the base model (scenario A) with Osaka's current condition are considered the reference value. The relative percentage differences between each scenario with a base model are determined. The increased albedo of urban fabric material (scenario B Cool pavement model) showed the most efficient to mitigate UHI. The relative percentage differences of the five criteria in the Cool pavement model are more significant than other models. Therefore, the results of this study can provide valuable guidance, both for keeping subtropical residents cooler and informing subtropical climate cities that would be sustainable in the future.

# 1. Introduction

The Urban Heat Island (UHI) occurs when a city metropolitan area experiences higher temperatures than the surrounding rural areas, which directly surrounds them [1].

The 2018 Revision of World Urbanization Prospects [2] noted that the urban population of the world had proliferated from 751 million in 1950 to 4.2 billion in 2018. The increasing urban population contributes to the development of new mega-cities and the existing mega-cities becoming more populated. Most of these mega-cities that have the largest population situate in tropical and subtropical areas. Therefore, it is essential for investigating the subtropical UHI phenomenon. There are several causes of the UHI effect in subtropical urban areas, including: (i) urbanization and increasing population [3]; (ii) fewer green spaces in the urban area [4]; (iii) low albedo construction materials in the urban area [5].

This research would analyse the microclimate changing and UHI mitigation strategies in a subtropical city centre (Osaka) in Japan. A three-dimensional model simulation software of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) named ENVI-Met (V 5.0.1) is adopted to visualise research results. The designed models employed to simulate thermal interactions between the built-up areas – vegetation – atmosphere condition on a micro-scale perspective and outdoor human thermal comfort is explored by ENVI-Met [6].

In this research, five scenarios (Base scenario, Cool pavement scenario, Cool roof scenario, increasing vegetation coverage scenario, and integrated scenario) with different albedo and vegetation coverage ratios have been designed to investigate the local climate changing under the UHI phenomenon in Osaka city centre. The five scenarios have been simulated by ENVI-Met. The simulation results of Scenario A (Base model) are considered the reference value. The five criteria (outdoor air temperature, sky view factor, net radiation, mean radiant temperature and thermal radiative power) are considered standard for evaluating the efficiency of UHI mitigation strategies. According to the simulation results and discussion, Scenario B has the ability to approximate decrease the outdoor air temperature (10% in summer, 20% in winter); net radiation (40% in summer, 20% in winter; Thermal radiative power (50%in summer, 40% in winter) and thermal radiant temperature (10% in summer, 80% in winter). Therefore, an increasing albedo of urban pavement is the most efficient mitigation strategy to manage UHI in a subtropical city.

# 2. Literature review

## 2.1. The main mitigation strategies of subtropical UHI

Mitigation techniques of subtropical UHI aim to balance the thermal budget of urban areas by increasing thermal losses and decreasing the corresponding gains [7]. For dissipating the excess heat, the mitigation strategies of UHI are usually divided into two categories: increasing urban albedo and increasing evapotranspiration. Increasing albedo is generally accomplished by increasing the albedo of the roof and pavement. An increase in evapotranspiration is performed by a combination of decreasing the distribution of impervious surfaces and expanding the space of vegetation in urban areas (shade trees, vegetated walls, and rooftop gardens [8]. All mitigation strategies constitute common relationships between energy and water cycles, environmental and socioeconomic measures, human activities and natural systems.

## 2.2. Green infrastructure

With subtropical climate conditions, the green roof can effectively mitigate UHI in Xiamen, China [9]. This research adopted high-resolution remote sensing images to collect the data for land use and land surface temperatures (LST) in Xiamen from 2014 to 2017. Besides, Landsat 8 remote sensing data (column number: 119,043) were selected to invert the LST. This research showed that the average LST difference between green roofs and Xiamen Island decreased by 0.91 °C. Besides, regression analysis revealed that for every 1000 m^2 increase in the green roof area, the average LST of the roof decreased by 0.4 °C.

The cool roofs and urban forestry also can mitigate UHI in Phoenix, USA [10]. Under current climate conditions, this study assessed the UHI mitigation strategies on daytime microclimate for a pre-monsoon summer day. They designed two climate scenarios by using the microclimate model ENVI-met. The results showed that the relationship between per cent canopy cover and air temperature is linear, with a 0.14 °C cooling per cent increase in tree cover for the urban. An increase in tree canopy cover from the current 10%–25% resulted in an average daytime cooling benefit of up to 2.0 °C at a local scale. Meanwhile, cool roofs reduced air temperature by 0.3 °C.

Besides, the differences in air temperature in Hong Kong have been simulated between extensive green roofs (EGR) and intensive green roofs (IGR) [11]. This research showed that EGR decreased air temperature by 0.4–0.7 °C, and IGR decreased by 0.5–1.7 °C. However, this research also presented that the cooling effect merely distributes in high-density buildings. Although of limited value, the GR still can mitigate UHI in subtropics, and the cooling effect of EGR is more visible in open-set low rise buildings.

## 2.3. Cool pavements with advanced higher albedo materials

The effect of pavements has been quantified on the urban thermal environment in Phoenix, the USA, at multiple scales [12]. A developed urban canopy model (UCM) was implemented into the WRF model (version 3.4.1). They evaluated the effect of pavements on the road and wall surface temperatures in Phoenix was investigated to identify the importance of thermal interactions between building–environment thermal interactions. The initial meteorological data for the simulation were collected from the National Centres for Environmental Predication Final Operational Global Analysis data. The sunny pre-monsoon period (12–17 June 2012) was used. To assess the performance of pavements, the researchers assumed that the road surface was 100% pavement with no trees or vegetation. The results showed that an increased albedo (0.6) of the pavement led to a pavement surface temperature reduction of up to 20 °C in the daytime. In most of the diurnal cycle, the reflective pavement led to the cooling of wall surface temperatures. The maximum cooling effect of about 1.9 °C occurred at 21:00 local time. This study revealed the importance of building-environment thermal interactions in determining thermal conditions inside the urban canopy.

Furthermore, a new permeable pavement structure called evaporation-enhancing permeable pavement has been assessed for UHI mitigation [13]. The new pavement has capillary columns in aggregate and a liner at the bottom of the pavement. Results showed that the capillary column was crucial in increasing evaporation by lifting water from the bottom to the surface, and the evaporation-enhancing permeable pavement was cooler than a conventional permeable pavement by 9.4 °C. Statistical analysis result reveals that evaporation-enhancing permeable pavement can mitigate the UHI effect significantly more than conventional permeable pavement.

## 2.4. Integrated strategy

The integrated urban planning and design strategies have been investigated to mitigate UHI using multi-sourced open satellite data [14]. The researchers adopted the local climate zone scheme to classify the two urban cities (Guangzhou, Hong Kong, China) based on the urban features such as building morphology and land cover. The results of the experiment indicated significant LST differences between pairs of local climate zones (LCZs). Compared with other LCZs, high density urban LCZs tended to have higher surface temperatures, while natural LCZs with a large percentage of vegetation have lower LSTs. The study provided that urban design is a fast and efficient way to mitigate UHI in a subtropical city.

Moreover, the urban configuration has been indicated that could influence the local thermal environment and mitigate UHI [15]. This research quantified the UHII in subtropical cities in China from Landsat 8 by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST. The results showed that a lower UHI occurred in the smaller built-up area with dispersed distribution when compared to the larger built-up areas. Besides, the urban configuration can influence UHI by 41% on a summer day and 51% on a summer night. Therefore, the design of urban configuration is an effective strategy to mitigate UHI.

## 2.5. Summary of the leading mitigation strategies in subtropical cities

Existing studies have concluded that many variables can affect the performance of mitigation strategies in subtropical UHI, such as the height and species of vegetation, leaf canopy cover of vegetation, the green coverage ratio of vegetation; the colour and density of surface; and the albedo value of building materials. Regarding the performance of mitigation strategies in subtropical UHI, the efficient mitigation strategies have been understood the key issues, such as air temperature reduction, land surface temperature reduction; energy saving; and thermal comfort improvement.

# 3. Background of the research area (osaka, Japan)

## 3.1. Study area

The study area is selected in Osaka, Japan, located in the subtropical area at latitude 34.6937° N and longitude 135.5023°E. In Osaka, the annual mean maximum air temperature is 20.08 °C, the mean annual air temperature is 15.9 °C, and the mean annual minimum is 11.75 °C. The annual relative humidity of Osaka is 65.3%. The annual average wind speed in Osaka is 4.5 m/s. Wind velocity in the winter and spring is high, and the wind direction is often from the north [16].

The research domain for the urban microclimate modelling covers an area of 2.5 km^2, which comprised the Chuo Ward and the surrounding area. This domain consists of typical urban land-use types: residential area, commercial area, industrial areas, roads, parks and open spaces.

## 3.2. Urban ground surface

The fraction of urban green coverage (UGC) in Osaka is under 9%, about 2% in the city centre. Increasing vegetation contributes to mitigating the UHI in several ways, such as intercepting solar energy and reducing the temperature of surfaces below while increasing the latent heat exchange for the evapotranspiration process [17]. Besides, asphalt and concrete constitute most of Osaka urban surface area. Asphalt and concrete have a low albedo, with values as low as 0.1 on average for asphalt and 0.3 for concrete. As a UHI mitigation strategy, surface materials with high albedo and emissivity have been proposed worldwide since they remain cooler when exposed to solar energy [7].

# 4. Method

## 4.1. Software and 3D model

This research uses the simulation approach to analyse the UHI mitigation strategies in subtropical climate zones. ENVI-met (version5.0.1) is a 3D software designed to explore microclimates by the fundamental standards of fluids and thermodynamics. It can simulate thermal interactions between building areas, soil, vegetation and atmosphere condition [18,19]. In numerical methods, ENVI-met uses an orthogonal Arakawa C-grid to represent its environment, and it adopts the finite difference method to solve a lot of partial differential equations (PED) and other aspects in the model. Therefore, ENVI-met only permits linear and rectangular structures (ENVI-met.info.com), and all the building structures are simplified to straight and rectangular in this study for easy simulation.

In particular, ENVI-met simulation is suitable for the subtropical city centres. A study is conducted in Hong Kong China [20] that demonstrated the proper tree planning is able to mitigate UHI effectively during daytime by using ENVI-met simulation. Besides, ENVI-met can calibrate the subtropical city São Paulo, Brazil [6] by combining land use data and field campaigns, microclimate measurements. Moreover, Shanghai China as a case study is validated ENVI- met software is still a helpful tool for modelling microclimate in the subtropical city centre [21]. Fig. 1 shows the research location (Chuo Ward) in Osaka, Japan. The 3D model represents the base situation of the research area in ENVI-met.

## 4.2. Parameters set in the ENVI-met simulation

The meteorological parameters are collected from Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). A typical hottest summer day (05/Aug/2019) and the coldest winter day (10/Feb/2019) are selected for analysis of the whole year subtropical UHI mitigation strategies. The start time of simulation is 07:00 a.m. rushing time and the end time of the 06:59 a.m. of the next day. The total simulation period is 24 h. The detailed simulation input parameters are shown in Table 1 (see Table 1).

# 5. Simulation results and discussion

In this study, outdoor air temperature ($T_a$), Sky view factor (SVF), Net radiation ($R_{n}$), thermal radiative power (TRP) and Mean radiant temperature ($T_{mrt}$) are standards for evaluating the efficiency of urban heat island mitigation strategies in the subtropical city centre. The simulation results of Scenario A (base model) is considered as the reference value. Scenario B (Cool pavement model), C (Cool roof model), D (Greenspace model) and E (Integrated model) have been compared with Scenario A to determine the relative percentage difference. The positive percentage difference represents which scenario has the positive ability to mitigate subtropical UHI.

## 5.1. Outdoor air temperature ($T_a$) and distributions

Fig. 2 shows the change in outdoor air temperature ($T_a$) during the research period for each scenario. The maximum, average, and minimum outdoor air temperature are $T_{a-max}, T_{a-avg}$, and $T_{a-min}$ for the five scenarios, respectively.

Fig. 2. The change of $T_{a-max}$, $T_{a-avg}$, and $T_{a-min}$ during the research period for each simulated scenario.

In the summertime, the maximum $T_{a-max}$ of Scenario A is 35.46 °C, which is close to the record temperature from the meteorological station. The maximum $T_{a-max}$ (45.64 °C) from all scenarios is observed at 12:00 in Scenario E during the research period. Scenario B has the lowest $T_{a-max}$ (33.24 °C), which is the most decreased model. In the wintertime, the maximum Ta is found in Scenario A at 14:00, and the value is 15.21 °C. The minimum $T_{a-max}$ (13.09 °C) have been found in Scenario B at 18:00. Besides, the distribution of $T_a$ are analysed in this research. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the distribution of $T_{a-max}$, for each scenario in summertime and wintertime.

Fig. 4. The distribution of $T_{a-max}$ for each scenario in the wintertime.

Scenario B has the higher temperature distribution inside the buildings and the lower temperature outside and around the street. However, scenario E has the highest temperature distribution inside the buildings but higher temperatures around the road and outside the buildings.

Fig. 5 shows the relative percentage difference of outdoor air temperature compared with Scenario A (base model). In the summertime, the percentages of $T_{a-max}$ significantly increased in Scenario B during the daytime, and it slightly increased during nighttime. Furthermore, the percentages of $T_{a-avg}$ and $T_{a-min}$ have been identified as the highest trend In Scenario C. This implies that Scenario B and Scenario C both are the great efficient model to decrease $T_{a}$ in the summertime. However, in the wintertime, the most remarkable percentages tendency of the $T_{a-max}$, $T_{a-avg}$, $T_{a-min}$ have been found in Scenario B. It indicates that Scenario B has the more efficient ability to decrease $T_a$ in the wintertime. Therefore, Scenario B can be considered as the most efficient model to reduce $T_a$ in summer and wintertime.

## Sky view factor

The Sky View Factor (SVF) is the fraction at a point in space between the visible sky and a hemisphere centred over the research location. The SVF serves as an index of urban morphology widely used for comparing thermal conditions in different building environments [22]. This study has set four locations to assess the SVF in simulation (Fig. 6). The average SVF for each simulated scenario is also shown in Fig. 6.

![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0360544222006247-gr6.jpg)

Fig. 6. Four selected points to assess the SVF and the value of SVF in each scenario.

The comparison of the SVF of each scenario showed that the highest average SVF had been found in Scenario B; the value is 0.31. The lowest SVF value is 0.15 in scenario E. According to Fig. 5, Scenario B has the highest SVF, decreasing net heat storage inside buildings and UHI. Besides, adding urban shading provided by extra vegetation makes the lower SVF in scenarios D and E.

## Net radiation ($R_n$)

The value of net radiation ($R_n$) is the difference between incoming and outgoing radiation of both short and long wavelengths. It depends on the temperature and reflectivity of the ground surface exposed to radiative exchange [23]Error! Reference source not found. . Fig. 7 shows the change of net radiation ($R_n$) during the research period. The maximum $R_n$ in summer time was found in Scenario A at 11:00, the value is 1936.01 W/ m^2, and that happened at 12:00 in the wintertime; the value is 1257.71 W/ m^2. Besides, the value of $R_n$ in all scenarios significantly decreased from 15:00 p.m. to 06:00 a.m. during sunset and night time.

Fig. 7. The value of $R_n$ for each scenario in summer and wintertime.

Fig. 8 shows the relative percentage difference of $R_n$, which compared with Scenario A. In the summer daytime, Scenario E is the most efficient model to decline $R_{n-max}$, Scenario B is the most powerful model to reduce $R_{n-min}$. Furthermore, in the wintertime, Scenario B generally has the most significant trend to decrease the $R_{n-max}$ and $R_{n-min}$ during the research period. To sum up, Scenario B is considered the most powerful model to reduce net radiation both in summer and wintertime.

## Thermal radiative power (TRP)

The thermal radiative power (TRP) is used to assess the impact of the solar reflectance of a surface on the UHI effect [24]. According to Stefan-Boltzmann law, the average TRP per $m^2$ of each element of urban surfaces in each scenario was calculated and shown in Fig. 9.

![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0360544222006247-gr9.jpg)

Fig. 9. The calculated average TRP per m^2 of each element of urban surfaces in each scenario.

In the summertime, the values of TRP in Scenario A and C were close during the research period. In Scenario D and E increased rapidly from 07:00 to 14:00, then decreased until 20:00. The values of TRP in all scenarios are stable during the nighttime. In the wintertime, Scenario B showed the lowest trend of the TRP values. The values of TRP in Scenario C, D and E were close during the research period.

Fig. 10 shows the relative percentage difference of TRP, which is compared with Scenario A base model. The highest percentage trend of TRP is determined in Scenario B in summer and wintertime. It means that Scenario B is the most efficient model to decrease thermal radiative power during the research period.

## Mean radiant temperature ($T_{mrt}$)

Mean radiant temperature ($T_{mrt}$) can be utilised to assess the human thermal comfort by evaluating the sum of all short wave and longwave radiation fluxes absorbed by the human body [25]. In this research, the following physiological data were assumed to calculate PET: male, 170 cm, 35 years old, and 70 kg. Besides, the heat transfer resistance of summer clothes to be 0.5clo, and the activity is 80 W, almost 1.3 m. Mean radiant temperature ($T_{mrt}$) can be used to evaluate the human thermal comfort by assessing the sum of all short wave and longwave radiation fluxes absorbed by the human body. Fig. 11 shows the change of $T_{mrt-max}$, $T_{mrt-min}$ and $T_{mrt-avg}$ for the five scenarios.

![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0360544222006247-gr11.jpg)

Fig. 11. The value of $T_{mrt-max}$, $T_{mrt-min}$ and $T_{mrt-avg}$ in the five scenarios.

The maximum $T_{mrt-max}$ in the summertime of all scenarios was observed in Scenarios B at 15:00; the value is 69.29 °C. The minimum value (23.69 °C) of $T_{mrt-max}$ was found at 05:00 in Scenarios E. In the wintertime, the maximum $T_{mrt-max}$ has also been found in Scenarios B, the value is 54.98 °C.

Fig. 12 shows the relative percentage difference of $T_{mrt}$, which is compared with Scenario A (base model). In the summertime, the stable percentages tendency indicated that $T_{mrt}$ has decreased insignificantly in Scenario C. Bedside, Scenario B has reduced percentages of $T_{mrt}$ in summer daytime, however, it has a significate increased $T_{mrt}$ in the summer nighttime. The results of $T_{mrt}$ reveals that Scenario B has the most efficient ability to decrease $T_{mrt}$ in the summer nighttime, however, it is unsuitable to decline $T_{mrt}$ in summer daytime. In the wintertime, the percentages of $T_{mrt-max}$ altered to peak during the afternoon winter time in each scenario. However, the percentages of $T_{mrt-max}$ are all negative during the morning and night time. The results imply that all Scenario B, C, D and E can decrease $T_{mrt}$ in winter morning and night time.

Fig. 12. The percentage of mean radiant temperature in summer and wintertime.

Scenario B has the highest negative percentages for reducing $T_{mrt}$ in the wintertime. It shows that $T_{mrt}$ is highest and reach the human comfort in Scenario B during the winter time. In summary, Scenario B is the best model to alter $T_{mrt}$ to achieve the higher human comfort during the summer daytime and night time.

# Uncertainty of results and sensitive analysis

Nowadays, numerical modelling is a capable way to help researchers advance UHI mitigation strategies. ENVI-met has been widely used to support microclimate-sensitive planning. Besides, this research should describe the meaningful characteristics of natural objects. In the Osaka city scale, the modelling process aims to simplify representing the city by computational methods. To ensure the certainty of simulation results, the simulation results of outdoor temperature ($T_a$) have been chosen to compare with the actual outdoor temperature organised by the local weather station and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The average $T_a$ of the local weather station is 30.19 °C and the average simulation $T_a$ is 30.91°Cduring the research period. The percentage difference is 2.35%, which is at a deficient level. Therefore, the simulation results can be considered relatively close and comparable to the real values.

Besides, according to the tutorials of ENVI-met (ENVI-met.com), the typical spatial resolution range is from 0.5 to 10 m. Sdeghat and Sharif (2022) studied that the modelled area is 280 × 510m, and the resolution is 5 m for simulating the urban heat island in Tehran, Iran [26]. However, the research area in this study is 500 × 500, which is bigger and more complex. Therefore, this study has considered saving the computing cost and time and combining the previous studies, limiting the resolution and grid cells to 10 m.

# Discussion, conclusion and further work

In this study, UHI mitigation strategies were assessed for a subtropical urban area. The results can provide valuable guidance to develop the UHI mitigation strategies for keeping subtropical residents more suitable for citizens and informing subtropical climate cities that would be sustainable in the future. The different mitigation strategies were analysed by a simulation ENVI-met. In this study, outdoor air temperature ($T_a$), sky view factor (SVF), Net Radiation ($R_n$), thermal radiative power (TRP) and mean radiant temperature () as urban heat island mitigation criteria are standards for evaluating the efficiency of UHI mitigation strategies. The simulation results of Scenario A (Base model) are considered as the reference value. The relative percentage differences between Scenario B, C, D, and E with Scenario A are determined. According to the simulation results and discussion, Scenario B can approximate decrease the outdoor air temperature (10% in summer, 20% in winter); net radiation (40% in summer, 20% in winter; thermal radiative power (50% in summer, 40% in winter) and thermal radiant temperature (10% in summer, 80% in winter). Therefore, Scenario B (the Cool pavement model) is the most excellent ideal model to mitigate subtropical UHI.

According to the results of this study, an increasing albedo of urban fabric material and an expanding vegetation coverage ratio both are efficient ways to mitigate UHI. Besides, a growing albedo of urban fabric material (Scenario B Cool pavement model) is a better efficient mitigation strategy than increasing vegetation coverage ratio (Scenario D green space model) in the urban area. This is because higher vegetation coverage has negative effects on city ventilation. Therefore, increasing more vegetation coverage is not a great way to mitigate UHI in the subtropical city centre. For further work, more efficient urban fabric materials should be developed and evaluated for the potential of improving urban microclimate.
