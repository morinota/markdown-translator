Collaborative filtering is a method of making predictions about an individual's interests or preferences based on the interests or preferences of other people.
日本語
It is commonly used in recommendations systems for products or content.
日本語
For example, if a group of people all like a particular movie, a collaborative filtering system might recommend that movie to a new user based on the assumption that the new user will also like it.
日本語
Collaborative filtering algorithms can be divided into two main categories: user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering.
日本語
In user-based collaborative filtering, predictions are made about a user's interests based on the interests of similar users.
日本語
In item-based collaborative filtering, predictions are made about a user's interests based on their past interactions with specific items.

Second, very few studies consider to use user feedback other than click / no click labels (e.g., how frequent user returns) to help improve recommendation.

We further consider user return pattern as a supplement to click / no click label in order to capture more user feedback information.

Subsequently, Gupta et al.[12] described a specialized system to generate Tweet recommendations in real time, insights from which were later deployed in GraphJet [31].

Given a sample from P(O|P), we can think of the IPS estimator from Eq.(10) as the Empirical Risk Rˆ(Yˆ ) that estimates R(Yˆ ) for any Yˆ .

The first is that they may not be general enough to overcome all sources of bias, i.e.they are often designed to compensate for a specific kind of bias: for example, the accuracy metric that is proposed in [24] is able to correct only for the long-tail popularity bias in a dataset.
